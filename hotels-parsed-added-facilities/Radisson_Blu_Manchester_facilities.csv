United Kingdom,Premium Room,1  ,September 2020,Couple," The Radisson Blu, Manchester Airport is located directly between terminals one and two, with an additional 3 minutes walk to terminal 3. The Radisson boasts large rooms, with extremely comfortable beds, perfect for a good night sleep-pre flight! Some of the rooms offer an impressive run-way view, which is ideal to get you into the holiday mood. Having stayed in both run-way view rooms and city view rooms, I did not hear any noise disturbances from the airfield. My partner and I always opt for the Radisson Blu, and usually book dinner at a nearby pub when travelling so I am unable to comment on restaurant services. However there is a very elegant looking restaurant/bar on site should you wish to dine. The biggest selling point however is the closeness to the terminals. Terminal 2 being a mere couple of minutes walk away, Terminals 1 and 3 being 5-7 minutes walk at most. The Radisson Blu is the perfect hotel for a pre-flight stay. Reception staff have always been extremely friendly and informative. I have stayed at this hotel many times and would absolutely recommend it to those travelling from Manchester Airport.",10.0,Perfect pre-flight hotel.

The staff were helpful and patient with the group.  We tried room service late at night as we'd gone for an extended nap in the afternoon, and the pizzas were nice.

United States of America,Superior Room with Runway View,2  ,March 2019,Solo traveler," When I booked this hotel for easy access to the London Heathrow Airport, I paid the extra money to have Breakfast and Dinner included. Don't bother! The breakfast was nothing to get excited about. Also, it was not explained beforehand that dinner would only be offered from a VERY limited menu (called the Bed and Breakfast option when I checked in). Only 4 options to pick from for main entree. It did offer Starter, Entree and desert. The started I chose was the Caesar salad, a real joke of 7-10 lettuce leaves with dressing. Since I stayed 2 nights, my choices were very limited. Don't expect to order from the regular menu! Ordered the bacon cheeseburger the first night. Hamburgers in the restaurant came in 3 sizes. My option was only the smallest on the menu. I DID pay for these meals, but I felt like the hotel/restaurant thought they were giving me my meals for free. Second night, had the Fish and Chips. Have you ever had lukewarm fried food? Well, that's what it was. The regular items being served at tables all around me looked very hot, tasty and worthy of a Radisson Restaurant.

The flight was on time so we had booked a month or so earlier. My wife stays here when she goes to relatives in south west Ireland as well. This time we had had the full Manchester. Airport treatment, walked for miles in totally unnecessary queue lanes -  when we hit them with an EasyJet load there was nobody at the passport machines, but they didn’t let us in about half way down, maybe they enjoy watching people dragging or carrying their luggage up and down a dozen or two times, meeting people for the first time as they pass time and time again, eventually by the time they hit the passport machines.feeling like old friends. To tell the truth, on the way out we could have done with a night at the Radisson following the trauma of Manchester Airport’s uniquely uncivilised ‘security’ treatment. Maybe if they persuaded whoever trains the Radisson staff to retrain the security staff at the Airport itself that might help passengers to be treated like human beings instead of ignorant cattle. Our room key didn’t work, so a staff member shot up to the room with new keys and a smile and an apology. At breakfast the staff were welcoming, making it feel that everybody was glad to see us, and of course, whoever was behind the scenes preparing the breakfasts had a touch of genius.",10.0,A perfect end to solve the problems of a lousy evening.,1,bed|food/drink|location|staff|

So as not to miss my long haul flight i struggled to walk alone through security. That was a real challenge as without the chair, I had to stand in a long queue for a long time.

Isle of Man,Superior Room with Runway View,1  ,October 2019,Couple, we had booked and paid for a superior room same as last week - we have been using this hotel since 2016 before and after our holidays as we have to travel to and from the Isle of Man. The receptionist said she would upgrade us and gave us a key for a room on the 8th floor - it was very embarrassing to walk into the room and there is someone sleeping in the bed who was wakended by us :-(   . We went back to reception so she offered us a further upgrade to executive room on 9th floor - our key did not give us access to exec lounge and the room was smaller than the superior room and had a shower and no bath it also over looked the car park instead of the runway view we had paid for so am hoping when we come over next month that we don't get offered an upgrade as superior room is far nicer than the exec room.,7.5,On the whole fabulous stay as always just disappointed in the room,0,price|bed|staff|bathroom|parking|location|

United Kingdom,Executive Room with Lounge Access,1  ,June 2019,Couple," To be honest the rest of the staff were unfriendly, unsmiling and couldn't care less, particularly the bar and Restaurant Managers. We had ordered cocktails and as they take a while to make we had ordered another. As I put my empty glass down the bar Manager arrived and asked if we were ordering another. He didn't seem to believe me when I told him we had, luckily the waiter arrived with our drinks. There was no greeting or smile just a sales push I didn't appreciate. By the way when you are paying £9 for a cocktail the glass should be full.
  This is the second time we have eaten in the Restaurant. Breakfast is nice but this is the second time the food at dinner has been dreadful. The pate was horrible dense, bitter, with soggy toast, no chutney. We were not asked how we would like our main meals cooked which were completely over cooked when they arrived.  My burger was so dry and over cooked I couldn't eat it. I asked the unfriendly waiter for another as I couldn't swallow it without taking a drink.  The Manager who was unsmiling and unfriendly asked what was wrong and I explained it was burnt and over cooked and asked for another, medium. The second burger was worse it was even more over done, when you cut it in half and squeezed there was no moisture. The Manager apologized and asked if I wanted another. I declined as any even I can cook burgers better than that. We had hoped the food had improved since our last visit but it hasn't.",8.3,Disapointing,0,staff|restaurant|food/drink|price|

United States of America,Superior Room with Runway View,2  ,March 2019,Solo traveler," See what I wrote above. Bar was INCREDIBLY overpriced and the main ""Manager"" was very rude. The bartenders were nice (Quasam?). He went the extra mile to find the bottle of wine I wanted but overcharged me. I pointed that out to him, and he apologized and made amends and corrected his mistake. The Main Manager actually made a derogatory comment to me about being American and a comment under his breath as to how ""they"" (I assume Americans) are not understandable referring to my accent. I ordered a Tanquerey, rocks, with olives. The young lady behind the bar said ""We don't have olives behind the bar"". I asked if they had cocktail onions. ""No, we don't have those ether.""  I asked in a nice way, how could you not have olives behind a bar? How do you make martinis. This was overheard by the Manager, who stomped over to a cooler, pulled out a jar of olives, and nastily said, ""Of course, we have olives"", like I was some kind of idiot. I told him that it was not me that claimed there were no olives, but the bartender. Then he got a shaker out and started to make a martini, still being very nasty in his demeanor. He also got out the vermouth. I said, ""No, I don't want any vermouth"". To which he answered, ""I know the recipe for a martini!"" I responded, well, I didn't order a martini, I ordered gin on the rocks with olives. Then he got really snotty. That's when he made the comment about Americans. This ended up costing me $15.

United Kingdom,Standard Room,1  ,October 2018,Couple," Dinner at the Hotel nice surroundings not to busy. We had got a package with breakfast and dinner. The dinner we had on the whole was not good. It was from the set menu. First course  chicken wings with dip very good and served nice and hot. I said if the next courses  be s nice meal But sadly  that was not the case I chose  the burger. Well presented but it wss over done and very dry  it was like eating cardboard. The bun was done to s crisp and not easy to get a knife through As for the rasher of bacon that was hard extremely  over cooked,It could of been done at Breakfast  and wss left over The chips was nice but as for the burger I could of got a better burger in Burger  King. I told the waiter and showed s bit of burger to him and showed how it broke up in prices as I touched  it. All he could say or our burgers are well done. I said  that's fine but they should have moisture  within them this is like eating  cardboard
The desert  I asked if was a backed cheesecake  he replied  it's not hot.
We both had that it arrived nice presentation  with raspberries  and a sauce  drizzled  over no ice cream or cream.It wss differently not baked.it was a biscuit  base√ filled with a mouse  type filling but it was not light it was firm, rubbery with far to much geletine. When eating it was cladding  inside your mouth.
I saw the matra De  (Supervisor )later she seemed to take it all in !! And went in some way of putting it right with a couple of glasses wine.
Also found out that they did not deliver your newspaper to your door outside but you had to get it from reception and the weighing scales  it's a 1.00pound. It's less money 20p for putting air in your tyres 
These  things I would not have expected  paying over 200 pounds and a 4 star hotel.
But from that it's very convenient  for terminal  2.

Appreciate corporate cost cuttings are essential to maintain competitive room prices, but I've paid 60 percent less at Ibis and McDonalds and enjoyed an excellent drinks tray including biscuits.  
Bit of an inconvenience when the toilet failed to flush, no pun intended.  Reported it on checking out, hopefully it was sorted for the next occupants.   Only dicovered the problem in the early hours of the morning, therefore could not report it sooner.

At breakfast, staff may well have helped if I'd asked, but I had to make several trips between the buffet and table to take juice, cereal, fruit, bread/croissant, jam and plate of hot breakfast. A tray would have been a big help.  If there were some there, I didn't see them.
Big disappointment were the home-baked rolls - white and dark.  Rock-hard and dry.  Been sitting exposed to the dry air too long.  Completely dehydrated.
As I said above, croissant didn't suffer the same fate.  All that butter, I suppose!
Coffee a bit disappointing.  Don't drink it often, so maybe it's how proper coffee drinkers like it.

I just wanted some plain chicken and some potatoes. Eventually he went and asked and i had to go with a cesar salad which was on a bed of the sauce i can't have. Seriously, plain chicken on top of stuff I can't have. It's an expensive restaurant and should be able to cater for the unexpected, especially to ask the chef at least.

I wish there was an informal place to get a herbal tea and sandwich.

Staff were pleasant and competent but not particularly knowledgeable, nor did they go out of their way to help. I asked two staff for help with directions and parking. They sent me off to another floor and then continued their conversation. I came by about 1/2 hour later and they were still standing around chatting.

All we were offered was a complimentary pint of beer. Really disappointed as our local village pub can still provide fresh food on any night of the week and this is what we got after paying £200 for a room and still charged £50 for the meal and if you would like to contact me about this please do.

United Kingdom,Premium Room,1  ,October 2020,Couple," Breakfast was very disappointing. The waitress who greeted us was friendly and helpful, took our order for coffee and when she brought the coffee took our orders for hot food. 
There was a buffet available with individual portions of cereals, fruits, muffins, ham, etc., but we decided to select the hot option. I chose the full English breakfast and toast, while my girlfriend chose the breakfast panini. After about 10 minutes the waitress returned to apologise and say that they had no paninis left and so took an order of sausage and scrambled egg as a substitute. 5 minutes later she returned with a panini and said the chef had managed to find one. She then reconfirmed my order 15 minutes after taking it and I had to wait another 5-10 minutes before it was served. The overall impression was of a kitchen that was badly disorganised.
Both options were not particularly good quality. The panini wasn’t toasted very well and didn’t appear to have any egg mayonnaise. The full English was all there, but none of it tasted particularly good. The coffee was also not particularly good. 
As we had arrived late the previous evening after a flight we hadn’t eaten dinner and so we’re looking forward to a tasty breakfast on Sunday morning before starting our long drive home.

I had room service for dinner and breakfast and the dinner was alright but the breakfast was a complete joke. I ordered cold breakfast for roughly 15£ + 5£ room service charge. It said it would have bread, croissants, Danish pastries and jam. I received 3 mini chocolate croissants and that is it. There were 3 tabs of butter and jams and no bread or anything to have it with... seriously? It was an unwelcome joke. I only ordered sweet items (organe juice, tea, fruit yogurt and fruit) and they did not forget to include ketchup and mustard - what for? Seriously disappointing tu and unprofessional.

After a short wait we were shown to one of the side rooms, they are dark and the light above the table wasn’t working.  We asked to sit in the main room but were told others had been queuing for those tables and that he was doing us a favour giving us the table we had.  We decided we weren’t going to sit there we went back to the desk and asked him for another table.  Another group were at that time complaining because they had visited the restaurant at 4pm to book their evening meal and had arrived to be told there was no booking.  We sat and waited for about 15 mins then were shown to another side room, meanwhile others were shown to the main dining room.  As far as I could see these were people who had turned up without a booking, were allocated a time then waited in the bar.  There was no apology, but there was an acknowledgement, after the man serving us went to check, that the person we had booked with had forgotten to write it down.  It is worth noting also that I had reserved a table on arrival to avoid sitting in one of the side rooms.

Every time you ordered from the restaurant, room service or at breakfast you were asked if you’d left a deposit against your card at the desk when checking in.

Check out was the same, one guest in front and waiting time. I had to ask if I can check out also at main reception. Another guest was in the lift and said that he is not happy about the odd approach. At the main reception I was not even ask if I enjoyed my stay. Only that all is set.
Had ask at the evening if I can get a Coffee to go in the Executive lounge early morning and when I have been there at 6:30am were no Cups to go available.

I asked at the reception if it was normal for house keeping to come in that early which they said it wasn’t and then was shrugged off with a “oh sorry about that”.

Didn't have a clean supply if glasses despite it being pretty quiet. Felt rushed to get out . Don't understand why the lounge itself shuts even though didn't need drinks   surely could stay open as a seating area  with TV.  Prices should have been reduced to reflect the work going on . Food overpriced .19.99 for a chicken leg !,5.0,Fair,0,staff|dirty|noisiness|food/drink|location|tv|price|

Isle of Man,Premium Room with Runway View,1  ,July 2018,Couple," When we arrived the hotel was undergoing extensive building works. Only one lift was operational which caused a huge queue to form. Room service had temporarily been suspended and only pizzas were available. The hotel restaurant was, as a consequence, fully booked with a long waiting list, the first table being available at 10pm. We were forced to go out to terminal 2 to find a Spar shop and buy takeaway food. If the scheduled building works had been known to us beforehand, we would most certainly have booked another hotel. All in all, a very disappointing stay. Full marks for undergoing renovation during peak holiday season!",5.4,Poor,0,staff|restaurant|location|food/drink|
Oman,Premium Room,1  ,August 2018,Couple," Music too loud in the restaurant in the evening and such everyone there seemed to have shout over it to be heard.

United Kingdom,Standard Room,1  ,August 2018,Couple," Mattresses were stained yellow and brown, not comfortable. 2 staff were lovely the rest were rude and unhelpful. They put us in a room which they knew had a broken minibar (hot weather need cold drinks). Only one vegetarian option in the restaurant. Ordered room service they messed up the payment and demanded we come out of our room to fix it.

United Kingdom,Superior Room with Runway View,1  ,August 2018,Solo traveler," The location of this place is so convenient they don't have to try too hard, so they don't.

2. The sink was blocked. I called the receptionist for help, he just told me he cannot do anything (really unhelpful and unfriendly staff). I asked if there is anyone can help and fix the sink because it was too full and could not use at all. He said no, the only thing is to change room. (at 12am?!)",5.4,Fair,0,staff|
