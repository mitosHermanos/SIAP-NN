Positive to mention is also that the staff was very kind and supportive. I arrived at 9am.

Australia,Superior Twin Room,1  ,July 2019,Solo traveler," I understand it was a busy night and the hotel were understaffed but hearing that our room was given away to another group who extended their stay was concerning. I was understanding that the team had to make another room but waiting 4 hours is ridiculous. My friend and I had a function at 9:30pm and therefore only had 1.5 hrs to get ready and spend time in the room I paid a lot of money for and wanted to relax in after a hard week. The customer service for the inconvenience was next to nothing. Yes there was a verbal apology but there wasn’t any mention of anything to make it up to us besides a whole orange, pear and mandarin sent to our room. The least the hotel could do would be to give me a credit, a bigger room or complimentary dinner. In the morning I was still little disappointed and so I asked for a late checkout and complimentary breakfast for my friend and I for which the manager said okay. When I checked my emails at home, I was charged $65 for this so called complimentary breakfast... im angry and I will not stay here again.",7.9,Disappointing,0,price|staff|food/drink|

That's fine so I went to reception (3m away) and confirmed myself. Then I went to inform the porter that I was indeed checked out. The concierge got himself involved for no reason to confuse things. Fine.
Then after everything was solved, no thank to the concierge, he decided to move from his desk and approach me in the waiting area to inform me that concierge and reception are two different things and that he cannot pass messages on (3m to his right).
If that's a rule, fine.
He then went on to lecturer me the difference between a concierge and reception and that ""I might not be able to COMPREHEND the difference""
My reply was swift.
As an international pilot, I assure you I can comprehend the difference and in fact I am very familiar with a far more impressive service than yours. 
The fact he removed himself from his station after I SOLVED the issue to insult my intelligence was very unusual and disconcerting.

United Kingdom,Standard Double Room - Atrium View,1  ,June 2020,Couple," At reception they couldn't find my booking and were rather abrupt in dealing with the situation, which was in fact their own administrative error. Anyway, that aside, having paid a reasonable amount for the accomodation, we were excited to be offered an upgraded to a superior twin double room, from a standard double room. The reception told us this room would be more spacious and we (as a couple) could just choose which bed to sleep in, as it had two double bed. Unfortunately, the beds were pretty small doubles, so I can only imagine they were smaller than the standard double room bed size, which is understandable if one person is anticipated to sleep in each bed, but as a couple, I don't know if this was really a good upgrade to have been given. Additionally, there was loud music playing until the early hours of the morning, which didn't help with obtaining a comfortable nights sleep. In the morning, we had also paid for breakfast to be included. On making our way to the breakfast room we were taken to a table and given a menu with priced item, no explanation. After being left for a considerable amount of time, the same waiter came back and asked if we'd been served. We proceeded to ask about the breakfast, being understanding that buffet style is not suitable in the current global situation, but being a little confused having been given a menu with different prices and options and not knowing what exactly our prepayment entitled us to. Once explained we ordered from the menu as directed, however the resulting dishes were disappointing at most. With a very small offering to begin with, you'd hope the dishes were at least worthy of their spot on the menu. However, the orange juice (priced on the menu at $7, one glass of which was included in our breakfast allowance) was very poor quality and came in a very small glass.",7.0,Night Away,0,staff|price|bed|noisiness|comfort|food/drink|location|restaurant|

Philippines,Superior Twin Room,2  ,May 2019,Family," Our complaint about the very poor and rude handling of our concerns against one of their housekeepers named ""Faldo?"" was not handled well by the front desk manager named Mr. Islam. Not a single word of apology was received nor an intervention from the Housekeeping Department Manager named Maureen was received. We felt the VERY STRONG   DISCRIMINATION from this  other cultural race  but NOT from the Caucasians or Asian (Thai and Malaysia) personnel from the Concierge and restaurant who were very helpful. ,My husband also witnessed the same race reprimanding an innocent personnel, within the hearing distance of the guests regarding a car that was parked in front of the hotel. It is HIGHLY EXPPECTED that service-oriented 5 star hotel such  as this should not be doing it in front of the guests, Other  than the very expensive price we paid per night in Radisson Blu, O'Connelle St. , it is unfortunate that our last  holiday stop WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT. There was no discrimination felt from our other hotel accommodations we stayed in within Australia.",4.2,A DISAPPOINTMENT & A  RACIST HOTEL except for the warm Asian Thai & Malaysians)  &  Causcasian.,0,staff|restaurant|parking|price|

And they dont offer a variety of coffee at breakfast, and when spending that amount of money for 1 night you'd assume they could spare $20 to get you a little something to make you feel special for celebrating at their hotel, and you'd definitely expect to at least be offered a latte/cuppacino etc at breaky.
