Even if the hotel is in the middle of everything, I appreciated it that the hotel was somewhat sound proof. You could hear people from next door going in and out but that was it. No sound from the traffic or anything, which was nice. The staff are very customer service oriented and were attentive. Awesome that there was a minibar in the room. I loved that you could use a hand control to control everything in the room.

We arrived by train from Brussel and the hotel is in-front of the Centraal Station, you can see it clearly. The next day, we took excursion to Zaanse Schans Windmill and meeting point was at Central station. It made this hotel as a perfect choice for us. We also took the small boat cruise where the meeting point was at Anne Frank house, its <10 mins walk from the hotel. The Dam Square and red light district are all walking distance. There are 2 Malaysian restaurant nearby (Wau and Nyonya), where we feel like home. I would rate 10 for location.
The concierge personnel was very nice and polite. We opt for Van Gaugh museum & hardrock café and decided to take a taxi from the hotel despite the suggestion from him was a tram. We realized the taxi was a bit pricey (>20 Euro for one way). The hotel provide luggage storage and washroom for refreshing if your flight/train leave later in the evening, but make sure you ask for toilet key from front desk.

Namibia,Superior King Room with Iconic View,3  ,July 2019,Couple, The Hotel has a great location. Communication with the hotel if you intend to book directly is a bit slow and not very professional. The first room we checked in was beyond what we expected and not acceptable but the hotel went out of their way to assist with a better room. Our second room was clean with a great bathroom (walk-in shower) Additional requests in correspondence were ignored and late check out was not possible as that can't be pre-arranged unless you are willing to pay for an extra night or win the room lottery on the day you check out to be one of the lucky 2 rooms for a late check out. Excellent breakfast with very friendly and competent/attentive staff.

Also very near to a traditional Dutch fries store which was amazing. The staff were SO lovely! On one occasion the lovely receptionist asked my boyfriend and I what our plans were for the day, we said we were off to the Moco Museum aka Banksy exhibit and the lovely gentleman booked our tickets for us there and then, then when we got to the museum we could skip the long queue thanks to the lovely gentleman on the desk! Checking in was easy, checking out was even easier! 24 hour reception is great for funny flight times like ours! There's a lovely lounge/bar, a very modern stylish gym, and a pool that's to die for after a long day of exploring! The rooms were wonderful, elmis products in the bathroom!

China,Superior Twin Room,4  ,August 2018,Couple," This hotel is the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed at. It was the most terrible experience I’ve ever had. Our rate was over 320 euros per night. When we arrived, a male and female receptionist gave us a very tiny room despite that this hotel was in a low season with lots of empty rooms. We tried to confirm with them that if all the rooms are same sized, and they lied by saying ‘yes’. How terrible and horrible are they, trying to rip customers off. We required them to change us to a room which values the outrageous 320 euro for three times. Each time they gave us a little bigger one. If we did not insist and they would never tell the truth. Where is your integrity and honesty, this is the way you treat your guests? This is not end of story. The hotel’s alarm was triggered by a ‘God-knows’ reason. Every guest was robbed from their sleep 4 clock in the morning. Firemen appeared but found nothing like a fire warning. After over 40 minutes of this ridiculous disturbance, their pathetic explanation was ‘something wrong with the system, not our fault’. Come on, it is your hotel, this faceless explanation is so absurd. Of course it is your fault. And also, the hotel’s staff wear so fake smiles and treat guests impatiently.

The bathroom in the online photo’s looked big, ours was so small we both couldn’t stand in it at the same time. There is no heating in the room just airco. I wasn’t impressed with the room. We were told when we checked out that due to Covid many of the rooms had their furniture removed.

United Kingdom,Superior King Room,3  ,August 2020,Couple, As it was my partners b day I asked for an upgrade to an executive king room. This was confirmed. Shortly before we departed for Amsterdam I asked them to reconfirm as it was a surprise. Again I was told not a problem. Arrived at the hotel  and a bit of a wait even though there were 4 staff on the front desk they seemed to be slow getting guests  checked in. We went to the room we had allocated to us only to find it was the original room we booked. The lady at the front desk made it seem as though it was my fault for not confirming again at the front desk on arrival even though I had twice by email. Eventually she offered a free room upgrade but the moment had passed for the birthday surprise so we stuck with our original room which was nice enough. The pool changing rooms were closed due to COVID so it was a case of going back to you room wrapped in a towel if you didn’t what to change in front of people. Pool was nice but the filters were really dirty inside a could have done with a clean. Due to COVID we were told the the cleaning staff wouldn’t clean the room unless requested. We requested at the front desk the next morning but no one came. Finally went to concierge as we had no fresh towels soaps or hair shampoo and literally had to beg to have someone clean the room as he said we’d now missed the cut off time for requesting the room cleaned.

Belgium,Superior King Room,1  ,January 2020,Couple," We had an issue at check-out with the staff who made us pay an extra (so-called newly due) visitor tax. Yet, I had already prepaid our stay INCLUDING (!) a visitor tax. When I had shown this to the girl at the reception desk, she told me it must be because it's a new tax. Yet, I had booked this stay already a number of days after the ""starting date"" of this new tax I had read nothing about. Hence, my stay ended in dissatisfaction, as (1) it is illegal to impose twice the  same tax and (2) no information was given prior to checking-in. It was just imposed upon checking out, leaving me with no choice as if I was a difficult guest. And (3) the girl didn't have the slightest commercial touch and cancelling the 3 euros it was about... 
This came on top of a small issue at check-in when another member of staff had said that at that time of day (22:15)  in the very heart of Amsterdam no other restaurant was open but a McDonald's around the corner...

New Zealand,Executive King Room with Iconic View (3 Adults),1  ,July 2019,Family," When I booked I had paid extra for an expensive room - Executive King room with Iconic views for 3 adults $576 NZ as we only had the one night in Amsterdam so we thought spend the extra its going to be special.  The picture of the room on booking.com looked much bigger ( there were 3 of us and looking through the photos now not sure got the room we paid for) and showed rooms with large windows - or 3 sets of french doors even -that started lower to the ground with lots of light and amazing views. The room we got had one set of windows up higher from the floor which were not easily accessible because the sofa bed was up against that wall where the window was - when we tried to open them (while standing on the sofa bed)  they had a safety restraint and opened only so far. Fair enough we thought - safety first -  So we tried to put our phone out the gap of the window to take a photo of this Iconic View and noticed there was black safety mesh net all over he outside of the building so we couldn't properly see the Iconic view or even take a picture of it through the mesh. If you are going to charge extra or even put that in the statement line in the information don't you think you should be able to see it unemcumbered? When you look at the photos online you cant see any net on the outside of the building, the rooms look a lot bigger and do not properly represent the room we actually stayed in. I did go back down to reception and query this view situation and they offered us free breakfast which was nice but I would rather have had what I thought I was paying for. I always try to avoid confusion on check in so I had already asked  - this is what we booked is this what we are getting - the answer was Yes.

We were lined up at the check in counter awaiting our turn, and this guy impatiently motioned for us to come near him. At first he said he could not find our reservation. Then he said that was because ""the system changed the name of the reservation"", which I find unbelievable. He appeared angry, irritated or preoccupied with something else.  He was banging his stapler on the table/counter several times, as if he was unhappy with his job. If there was something else troubling him, then he should not have handled the check in counters at that time, because it left a very disappointing experience on us as guests.
The staff at the breakfast restaurant were however really great. They were smiling and very eager to serve the guests. One lady staff even offered to take a picture of us with a beautiful background of the restaurant. That was really sweet. 
However, the same disappointment came again after check out. We left our luggages near the reception as we had extra time to spare before our train trip. However, when we came back to get our luggage, we wanted to use the restroom first. Another guy at the lobby loudly admonished us, telling us that we were not allowed to do so. We were greatly embarrassed because he did it in a loud voice for the other guests to hear, as if we were caught doing something illegal inside the hotel. 
We had to stand up for ourselves and tell the guy that we were guests of the hotel! But the experience left a very disappointing feeling in us.

Ireland,Superior Twin Room,2  ,December 2018,Group," We returned one evening to find that our room hadn't been serviced properly. Housekeeping had simply replenished the towels but had taken the room card we had left. We called reception and explained the situation and asked them to send up some of the items that were missing, ufortunately this took a few phonecalls to try to resolve and eventually we called down to reception to speak in person. They weren't concerned at all that the room key was missing and couldn't offer an explanation as to why our room had been left the way it was or indeed an apology! We asked for new keys for security reasons and only then were we offered complimentary breakfast. 
When we checked out there was a charge of €4 which couldn't be explained, the receptionist insisted it was city taxes but I explained that they were already paid and were more than €4! She then insisted we must have had something charged to the room which we hadn't so we asked her to find out what the charge was and her reply was ""it's only €4""  at this point we just paid it and left as we had a train to catch and it was very obvious that she really couldn't care less!

Next days we came back not before 16:00. The""make my room"" sign was always on, when leaving the room.

Every time the coffee or shower gel was not replaced ( yet they put more than enough sugar, creamer or body cream)-I got my coffee by request daily. Our TV did not work. Second night I asked the technician to fix it, but after a short check he went out saying it is a system setting to be made, no result; next evening I get down to reception-no reaction, third time i go day time to reception and in 10 minutes I have the visit of an another technician that fix the problem-a faulty cable; nice for a 4 star hotel in the heart of Amsterdam.

Israel,Superior Twin Room,2  ,July 2018,Group," * I booked a twin beds room for 2 people, I emailed them in advanced to make sure that the twin beds room I ordered was ready for us before we got there. I told them in advanced that I am going to arrive at 02:00 AM.
They reassured me and confirmed that the room will be ready for us as described without any troubles.
Even though I did all of this, when I arrived I've been told that the room was given already to someone else because I arrived so late (even though I emailed in advanced that I was gonna arrive late)
and I was given a double-bed room instead.
The room is a bit tiny, but I didn't mind that as it facilitated everything I needed except the AC:
* The Air Conditioner is too weak, it couldn't compete with the hot weather in Amsterdam. It took many many hours of the AC working before the room cooled down so I could fall asleep and until the room was cool enough I couldn't fall asleep from the heat.
Actually I wanted to pay extra for a hotel with a good AC to combat the heat, but I felt like I paid the extra (compared to other results) without getting the extra AC benefit I was hoping for, for most of the night.
Overall the hotel was great, in better weathers I recommend staying in Amsterdam in this hotel.",7.5,"Nice hotel, nice location, nice staff, weak AC, does not give exact room as ordered upon arrival.",1,0,bed|temperature|price|

Australia,Superior King Room,3  ,January 2020,Couple, Stayed 3 nights. Two nights the room next door was extremely noisy and kept us awake for numerous hours during the night so bad that we had to call reception numerous times to be shown no empathy just that security ‘would sort it out’. Obviously wasn’t the case when we had to call again! As the room was also adjoining there was a cigarette smoke also coming into our room even though it’s was supposedly none smoking. During check out when asked our stay we again relayed the incident to which we got a ‘well we could change your room’. Seeing as we were checking out this was no consolation.

The TV had lots of digital interference... not that you're there to watch tele, shower was okay, but not the best I've had in (lesser) hotels.

Bahrain,Executive King Room,3  ,November 2019,Solo traveler," I pre-paid for a 3 day stay of an Executive King Room with Balcony & Bathtub vía booking.com , I chose the hotel based on that criteria, but when I got there, the non-refundable room I pre-paid for was not available.
I was asked to show the confirmation as they only have 2 rooms in the whole hotel that match that criteria, I was even told that I needed to contact the property before hand to request the balcony and the bathtub even though I had written confirmation about the room features.
So I showed how in my confirmation it was clearly stated that the Executive King Room had those features, I was told “No, those are just the hotel features” which I replied these are clearly the room features as is under the Room features tab to what the staff member agreed.
When I did the check in the receptionist assured me my room had the balcony and the bathtub as I asked before signing the check in form, so when I go up and I see no balcony I was angry...
Had to come down again and had to ask to speak to the manager, then I was told the balcony does not open anyways due to safety reasons so its the same as having a window....what kind of answer that?!
I was told I was lucky as they have found a room with a bathtub and a view and that was an “upgrade” because this room had a view even though it did not have the advertised balcony. (Room 137)
Obviously by now I’m getting more and more angry , thinking why did I choose to book in this hotel where I’m being charged +600 euros for a 3 day stay and not even getting what is advertised.
After a lot of pushing the manager came and I was finally shown and offered the twin room (2 small beds) with balcony & bathtub which was significantly smaller and did not take it.
I paid for THE king size bed, THE balcony and THE bathtub and that’s  what I expected to receive upon my arrival.

when we entered the main entrance with lots of luggage, never thought there will be stairs right after the door (it's a 5 star hotel). we expect the concierge people to notice and help to lift the luggage up cause i'm travelling with seniors. but no, no help at all was given, not even a greeting! 
check in was handled with staff that should not be placed there cause she was not fit, had a cold and keep touching her nose. where's the hygiene?
raining, no umbrella in the room for you. asked in the concierge, the answer is to check nearby their desk, if none means no more. 
minibar is super annoying! it's an automatic fridge system. but i paid for the room, i expect i can put things into the fridge, but the second you move things, it will charge your room bill straightaway! had to cool my things near the window instead!

Australia,Superior King Room with Iconic View,5  ,November 2019,Couple," Two main issues:
(1) The room really felt like a 3-star hotel masquerading as a 4-star hotel
     - very dimly lit room
     - poor heating, requiring that the hotel provide a second, portable heater (which they kindly did)
     - the cheapest of tea & coffee facilities possible, with a $15 kettle and no milk
     - basic bathroom (no towel heater, no toilet brush)
     - The hotel's iconic building facade only houses reception, the bar and restaurant.  Most rooms and some facilities are in a seperate building, requiring two lift rides and a walk across an inter-building bridge.
(2) Additional services were charged at an extortionate rate
     - laundry service
     - room service food was ordered on one occasion and never again, as the expensive steak meal ordered came with absolutely no accompaniment (vegetables or chips).
For the cost, the hotel was simply not up to snuff.  Accommodation in the centre of London and Paris at a comparable cost were significantly better value.

There was also a loud and constant dropping sound in the room from above that couldn't be fixed. One of the staff members (Jordi) was very nice and tried his best to fix it for us but it wasn't possible -he booked for us another room for the next day, so we had to live with that for the rest of the night. Then at around midnight someone started to smoke in a room near us and the smell in our room got pretty strong. We called the reception and another guy told us that he would send someone. We were waiting for half an hour but no-one came. We called again and the same guy obviously didn't remember neither the issue nor our room and said that everyone was busy therefore he couldn't help but will try his best. No-one came for another 20 mins. We decided to switch on the air- conditioner and go to sleep. A huge bulk of dust dropped out of air conditioner. Btw a handle of the bathroom door also dropped - it wasn't fixed... We didn't stay in the hotel for the rest 2 nights that were booked. We spoke in the morning with the manager but she didn't apologize.

United States of America,Superior King Room,1  ,September 2019,Couple," Having said that, some comments:
1.	 Regarding high tech, the person bringing our luggage to our room could have spent more time explaining how the TV works.  We had great difficulty understanding all the prompts and controls on the TV remote.  And of course, the TV remote indicated a low battery level.  Maybe that created some of our difficulty whenever we pressed a button expecting it to work.  Hence, never really watched TV.
2.	While I realize European hotel rooms tend to be somewhat smaller than American hotels, I find it very inconvenient not to have any chest drawers available to unpack our suitcase.
3.	Ran out of Kleenex (nose wipers) in the bathroom almost immediately after we checked in.
4.	Your hotel clerk (male) checking us in was most rude and unfriendly, as if we were disturbing his day.  Admittedly, we got to the hotel early, with the Holland America cruise ship’s early disembarkation, and your hotel clerk (female)  could not have been more friendly and courteous in helping us store our baggage and advising when it might be advisable to recheck for early check-in prior to 1400 hours.  But when we arrived shortly before 1300 hours, your male hotel clerk insisted that no rooms were available and that we could not check in before 1400 hours.  Only after we advised him that the other hotel clerk (female) advised us that most likely they would have rooms available after around 1200 hours did this hotel clerk (male) reluctantly find us a room that was available (Room 103).  
5.	That evening, we had a drink in your hotel bar.  It took between 15 and 20 minutes to get our glasses of wine after we ordered them --- Unacceptable!  While I do realize us Americans tend to be somewhat impatient, nonetheless, that was unacceptable service. 
All in all, considering the cost of the room vs. value received, we cannot rate your hotel highly!",6.7,Poor value for the money!,1,0,tv|location|bathroom|staff|drink|restaurant|price|

The gentleman who helped me Saturday night got so distracted 4 to 5 times in a 5 to 10 minute time frame when I was trying to talking to him.. He must have been a man who wore many hats. I’m pretty sure he wasn’t a manager, but if he is then he needs a raise. I saw him helping a few guest with their bags either to their car’s or in the building, helping guest to the check in counter, and then working at the concierge desk, and I was not the only guest in line needing his help..

Australia,Superior King Room,4  ,August 2019,Solo traveler," I had wanted a room with a view but I was given a room at the very back corner of the hotel (265). The cleaner at Macdonalds in the alley behind the hotel made lots of noise at 3-4am every morning, waking me up. Considering jet lag, I could not get back to sleep for hours. The bathroom: there was orange mould in the grout of the tiles. This was extensive. The back of the glass door in the bathroom was dirty from top to bottom and not cleaned in a long time. It was covered in water marks and stains. The state of the bathroom was poor. I had trouble getting through to reception on the phone. The TV was not working. When I was able to get through to the Concierge, they said they would contact reception. After 90 minutes I managed to get through to reception who said they had not received the message. They sent someone up immediately who did reboot the TV.  I ordered room service. I wanted a desert with my dinner. They didn't serve desert in the rooms even though it said on the TV details about the hotel, that they did. However, after I raised my concern, Room Service rang me back to tell me they could arrange a desert for my meal. When the food was delivered I was told to leave the tray outside my room. I asked if I needed to ring Room Service to tell them it was ready to pick up. She said no. The tray was still there the next morning. I rang Room Service who said they would send someone to pick it up immediately. This did not happen. When I went to breakfast I told reception and the concierge. They said they would resolve it. It was still there when I went out at 11am.  Finally, on several occasions I had to wait for help at the Concierge desk while he was having conversations and chatting with other staff away from the desk. He continued to chat even when he saw me standing at the desk. When he did help me, there was no apology. As soon as he finished helping me, the man (an older man with glasses), went straight back to his conversation away from the desk.",5.4,I had high expectations and was disappointed in the overall standard of the hotel service.,1,0,location|dirty|noisiness|bed|bathroom|staff|tv|food|drink|

When we arrived, a male and female receptionist gave us a very tiny room despite that this hotel was in a low season with lots of empty rooms. We tried to confirm with them that if all the rooms are same sized, and they lied by saying ‘yes’. How terrible and horrible are they, trying to rip customers off. We required them to change us to a room which values the outrageous 320 euro for three times. Each time they gave us a little bigger one. If we did not insist and they would never tell the truth. Where is your integrity and honesty, this is the way you treat your guests? This is not end of story. The hotel’s alarm was triggered by a ‘God-knows’ reason. Every guest was robbed from their sleep 4 clock in the morning. Firemen appeared but found nothing like a fire warning. After over 40 minutes of this ridiculous disturbance, their pathetic explanation was ‘something wrong with the system, not our fault’. Come on, it is your hotel, this faceless explanation is so absurd. Of course it is your fault. And also, the hotel’s staff wear so fake smiles and treat guests impatiently.

There was no attempt by the hotel to soundproof the rooms by the door, so laying in bed, it was easy to hear conversations in the corridor and therefore anyone passing the room could hear the conversation within the room.
