Trouser press didn’t work which really wasn’t a problem and the bar that held the shower head came off as I tried to adjust it, meaning we could use the shower this morning but there was a lovely deep/wide bath so also not a big problem

It was very pale so there was obviously too much milk in it and it was sticky and heavy. It was served everyday except one, and surely the amount of scrambled egg being left uneaten on plates tells you something?? I asked for a fried egg, and that was OK, but if there was any chance of a cooked to order omlette, I didn't see the sign. There wasn't much fresh fruit, and it was mostly the same. Finally, I know coffee machines are a labour-saving device, but for the cost of the breakfast and the star rating of the hotel, It was not OK to be using a coffee machine, similar to one I saw the other day in Kwik-Fit!!

Asked to check in early as had two babies with me I was advised could check in early and to ask for the lady (Deena) when I arrived. So I arrived with a suitcase, crib, bag with bottle preps and tow babies in two to be told I could no longer check in early. And if I wanted to they could downgrade me which would cost more money but smaller bed which was a no as we had a bigger bed for a reason with 4 of us in a room.!!! Went back 4/5 times to ask about check in and was told to come back in 10/15 minutes each time! This was very stressful as they was fully aware the wedding was starting at 12 in their hotel and I had all my luggage with me plus the two babies! . Eventually the wedding started and we only got to check in exactly at the check in time! Was very unhelpful! 
The room once got in it was old and worn and smelt like it had been cleaned by a damp cloth all over!!

Your receptionist Dean came up to see the room and commented how bad it was, taken us to another room not much better.  Booked a superior room and got no slippers or robes, tea and coffee was not replaced on the second day. Breakfast was very poor quality ingredients, when you could get them.  You had to wait on cutlery and cups, at one stage we were told to use paper cups as they had no clean one.  On Sunday there was no bread and the chef came out to say if you can wait 9 minutes I could get some????? Hello you’re a hotel.  Ditch your scrambled eggs, disgusting.  Have the staff not told you how many plates go back with it on it because it is so bad.  Still waiting on Dean or someone (I think her name was Dina) to get back to us over a week later.  Not a happy customer.  Definitely not 4 star.

United Kingdom,Superior Room with River view,1  ,November 2019,Couple," Upon arrival of the property, there was a strange odour within the lobby area that myself and partner both noticed and said. We stayed on the fifth floor and there was also a strong smell of paint right a long the corridor, the paint smell can’t be helped obviously and there was plenty of signs to indicate what was still wet etc, but the smell in the lobby wasn’t the best start - wasn’t unbearable but wasn’t pleasant either. Our room was okay, it seemed quite dated and was clean enough. One of our bathroom lights was broke and flicked constantly when switched on, the tube needs replaced (room 508 - floor 5). Our bed was very low to the ground, and slanted. It felt as though I was a lot higher up than my partner, but I think this reason was because it was two king beds that had been pushed together to create the double. The pillows, and quilts were both comfortable and warm though. In the morning after what was an okay sleep we went to make a coffee each, when we had a look at the tea and coffee condiments there was a handful of different teas, plenty of sugar and sweetener but only one sachet of coffee, I don’t know if this was a mistake or the normality but was a problem for us as we both enjoy a coffee in the morning, what made it worse was that we had also ordered two with our breakfasts in the morning to the room, and it turned up without any coffee, and instead just orange juice which we didn’t order. Check out was fine and again pleasant, and we are certain that if we raised the issue with a member of staff they would have been kind enough to sort our demands. It wasn’t the best stay but can’t fault the staff, I just think I have for sure stayed in better Radisson’s elsewhere in different cities than this one and they have perhaps set a higher standard than this particular establishment.",7.9,Good Facilities and Friendly Staff.,0,location|noisiness|dirty|bathroom|bed|comfort|food/drink|staff|

We are both 60 years old and hardly look like hell raisers! We were both made to feel like criminals. I have never experienced this in any hotel I’ve stayed in all over the world. In fact in the last eight weeks I have stayed in 12 hotels and never made to feel like this.

United Kingdom,Standard Room,1  ,September 2019,Couple, The first upgraded room we were allocated had a cracked sink and the bath surround was broken. The view from the window of the river Mersey was lovely but the window surround was black with condensation as there were no vents.  When I complained at reception we were immediately relocated to another room. Here the bathroom was much nicer and the window surround clean. Unfortunately the air conditioning in this room did not work at all. Luckily we were given a fan by staff. Without this our night's sleep would have been very unpleasant.

I also didn’t like the fact that there was no clear way to contact reception via the telephone. I had to ask at reception what number to ring but you’d think it would be on the phone or in the room, also there wasn’t a hair dryer so we had to request one to be brought up.
They upgraded us to a business room with the promise of bottled water as a gesture of good will for the messing about but the water never arrived, we had to request it from reception and even then it was warm when it came.

Australia,Premium Room with River View,1  ,February 2019,Solo traveler," Nowhere at the time of booking, or in my non refundable booking confirmation email did it state that the credit card that was used for payment, would need to be presented at the time of check in.  I made this booking from Melbourne, Australia and this was a Christmas gift for my parents who live in Liverpool, England.  I noted that it would not be me who would be checking in, and gave the booking contact name and details.  When my parents attempted to check in, there were told that they had to pay for the room as they didn't have my credit card.  They were hit with a $311.61 (1 hundred and 72 pound) bill!!  My parents called me immediately and I spoke with Dinah on reception who was rude and unhelpful and passed the blame to Booking.com for not providing the hotel payment policy correct information.  I was told to call back on Monday (the booking was for a Saturday) and that I would need to speak with the hotel accounts team.  Since my booking was non refundable, even if my parents refused to stay, I would have still been charged!!  My Mum paid the $311.61 on her credit card and they continued with their planned hotel stay.  They had a really nice time, but the whole trip was tainted by the first encounter and the worry that they had to foot a very expensive hotel stay, when they only lived 40 minutes out of the city!  I called the accounts team as advised by Dinah on Monday and spoke to a really helpful lady called Natalia who apologized for the incident, processed a refund on Mums card and confirmed that the payment would be taken from my card, as originally planned.  The whole incident was very stressful and took the excitement, fun, and Christmas cheer away from the fact that this was supposed to be a Christmas present - it cut into my parents spending money and they spent the rest of the day/night being very careful with what they spent just incase the refund request was declined on the Monday when I was advised to call.",7.5,"Lovely hotel, great location, rude and unsympathetic reception staff!",0,price|staff|location|

I did this, and was called back after 20 mins and told there was no driver to bring my car round. I would have to be walked over to their secure parking facility to retrieve my car myself.  I was a bit miffed as this was done without any apologies for the inconvenience. I mentioned it at check out and was told the maximum discount they could offer was £5. The approach of the person was all wrong. A simple apology and offer to take £5 off the parking bill would have sufficed, rather than saying ""the max discount I can offer is £5"". This is especially because I only said ""it would be nice to apologise for the inconvenience or at least offer something for the inconvenience. I did pay for a valet service that I am not receiving in its entirety"".  It's simply good customer service and I didn't receive it. Instead, I felt a bit insulted!

United Kingdom,Superior Room with River view,3  ,October 2018,Couple," The room information was erroneous in that it said there was a fridge, but the policy has changed and all the fridges have been decommissioned. The front desk staff are happy to put things in a small fridge but you have to keep going up and down for that. There is a small ice bucket in the room with ice stations on each landing. Not anything like as good as having a fridge in the room though (we'd had plans for keeping some picnic-type stuff in the fridge and had to abandon that idea.)  The TVs were not working properly while we were there and this was a total hotel problem (except for the bar area) and the technicians were having trouble putting it right. We feel it was too expensive for what was on offer, although that is just a personal view. (Having said that, it you make good use of the pool and gym you are recouping a bit of the expense!) The restaurant was probably a bit on the dear side (but then so are a lot of eating places around the centre - we checked some of them out in passing). Finally, some might find it a little further away from the centre and main part of the waterfront than desired (incl. the river cruise start point opposite the Liver Building which is 12 mins' walk away, also the hop-on hop-off bus start points, and the Museum of Liverpool. The National Trust minibus tour of the Beatles Houses starts from Jury's Inn which is 25 mins' brisk walk away near Albert Dock, and the John Lewis area of shops would be about 20 mins. The cathedrals would probably be about 25 - 30 minutes' walk - bit less coming back as you are going downhill!)  - so check out the position to be sure, before booking. As it happened we didn't mind at all once we'd got our bearings, and we walked miles all over Liverpool (felt like it anyway!) and it was quite convenient to get back to. Otherwise it is not hard to get a taxi.",8.3,"We enjoyed staying here in spite of any negative points I have made, and Liverpool is a great city!",0,staff|tv|restaurant|location|price|fitness|

so we entered our room once the day had pretty much gone, and seen that there were petals on the bed which was amazing yet i got told prior to booking this hotel that no one is allowed to enter the room to decorate for our special occasion because of covid, yet someone was allowed to put petals on the bed where we sleep?
im really just not happy and would prefer our money back. we had little time in the hotel and the experience was ruined from the moment we arrived.",1.0,not happy,0,fitness|food/drink|staff|bed|covid|price|

For example, after a long journey to the hotel, a nice meal would have been great via room service. Dialled ‘0’ and waited 10 minutes for an answer to be told there is no room service. After all my problems with the second room, I was told that if I wanted my money back I have to checkout. Great customer service considering there is mould in your hotel.

United Kingdom,Standard Room,1  ,February 2020,Solo traveler," I was  giving to stay the room 313 and the major problem was bathroom - for me the bathroom should be a very cosy place where you  can relax taking a shower or a hot bathtub. Unfortunately the bathroom (toilet area and the shower) is designed for people with disabilities. There are people without any issues but there are people (like me) with different phobias and for me isn’t cool at all to use the bathroom and  being kind of scared of this facilities- very uncomfortable... there’s a must to be described all this facilities at the stage when you’re booking your stay - as when I booked the room wasn’t specified anything about that and definitely  wouldn’t be what I could ask for.
I’m pointing all this not expecting to be recompensed for this “unexcited experience”, I just believe all this missed details can be fixed and leave an amazing impact on your customers otherwise your staff (at the reception and in the morning at the restaurant at the breakfast  - I interacted only with them) were very friendly and helpful and is sad to see your staff hard work and delivering good customer service and to loose customers for such important details that somehow been neglected.

Undercooked bacon, overcooked tomatoes and hash browns.... empty fruit selections.  I should have saved my money and found another establishment to have breakfast.

United Kingdom,Standard Room,1  ,September 2019,Group," The rooms were very dated, with no plugs anywhere near the bed.  This is my pet hate in the 21st century!!  The air conditioning was poor and very noisy.  The facilities in the room were very basic, the mini-bar/fridge had been removed and there was no complementary water.  There were no additional pillows and when we requested some from reception they failed to turn up.  The hotel is based in a largely business area that is being heavily renovated so there are few restaurants, bars or other facilities nearby.  The road outside the hotel was closed due to construction and the nearest car-park was supposed to be 5 mins walk away but was more like 10.  The breakfast was a very basic buffet which was all self-service including coffee and toast so was more like a Service Station than a Radisson Blu.  The restaurant seating was a very odd design with tables of two sat almost next to each other.  The two coffee machines produced individual cups at a very, very slow rate, individually grinding each cup.  Jugs of coffee served by waiting staff would be far more efficient and a much better service to customers.  There were only scrambled eggs on the buffet and no additional options presented, the hash browns were anaemic and it was like a treasure hunt to find small plates for the cold food.  All in all a disappointing experience when compared to other hotels in the chain that we've stayed at.",5.4,Disappointing for a Radisson Blu - over-priced.,0,location|bed|temperature|noisiness|restaurant|bathroom|dirty|staff|parking|food/drink|

After nearly 2 hours I enquired when the food would arrive, they phoned 10 mins later and told me they hadn't received the order, and could sort it in 20 mins.
The food was okay, expensive for what it was, and there was a £4 service charge included.

It would have been better to have been told that the room was definitely not available until 3pm - and not raise our expectations.  Staff at reception were unfriendly and not usefully informative.   The experience did not get better from there.  The restaurant is easily the worst one we have experienced in our travels to date (4 weeks) around Europe and UK.  Rubbery and tasteless  food on the hot plates eg: scrambled eggs sitting in their own whey three breakfasts running; the best items being the sausages, bacon and tomatoes, which were at best, tepid; coffee not pleasant, sticky tables, One evening meal not available at 8.30pm on a Saturday as had run out of food - only Room Service available (?);  Fridges in room ""being decommissioned"", so no cold water;  all the glassware etc available ..   Here is the list we gave to Reception and left in the room as well :  Poor toilet flushing;  airconditioning unit very loud.  9 floors up, so if you turn it off, the room is too stuffy to sleep;  chair at table very unstable, looked as if it might implode when someone sat on it;  shower support loose- did not hold shower head upright or firmly;  shower door seal leaks creating a very wet floor - could slip.

United Kingdom,Junior Suite,2  ,March 2019,Solo traveler, The service was terrible this is pretty much been reflected in every bad review. I booked a suite here so it wasn’t cheap but was treated by staff almost like I should be privileged to stay there. Staff were rude and did very little to assist which sort of ruined the stay.

United Kingdom,Premium Room with River View,2  ,March 2019,Couple," The Premium room with River view (611) is quite shabby with quite a few bits of damage, one of the reading lights is intermittent, the desk lamp does not work at all. the marble desk surface has a crack all the way across it.
The TV seems only to have 5 analogue channels and the controller is intermittent.
There are no biscuits and the mini bar has nothing in it (staff advised all room fridges had been decommissioned)
The drawers have no sides so clothing falls out. 
We have already had to make a trip to reception because both the room cards stopped working. My wife got stranded in the fitness centre vestibule because the key card did not work.
We were told free lockers were available in the fitness centre, however when we got there we were told a £1 coin is needed to rent padlocks (the attendant did lend us 2 free when we told him we had no change).
The male toilet light was faulty.
The spa area is quite shabby with various damage and areas of bare plaster, we did not feel the area was very hygienic. The changing rooms are poorly furnished with no costume dryers, unspecified product, no obvious moisturiser or conditioner.
I raised these items with staff, they responded positively, offered a room upgrade and free breakfast. I declined the room upgrade as I didn't want to move clothing etc. for 1 night in a better room.",5.0,Disappointed,0,location|tv|internet|restaurant|staff|fitness|bathroom|dirty|food/drink|

United Kingdom,Premium Room with River View,2  ,March 2019,Couple," So first impressions of this hotel were very good, the location of the hotel is pretty good too, I requested a room with a view of the river outside and the hotel provided this.
The main lobby is very modern and clean with access into the restaurant and bar area, the check in area was a little busy but only took a few minutes to clear.
This is where we get to the bad bit... The room, from the description on the website was meant to be a really nice room.. I was visiting for birthday celebrations so naturally chose what I thought would be a nice hotel. Upon entering the room, we noted how dated the room was looking and that it was not modern to the same standard as the main lobby area.
The bed was actually quite comfortable and we had a sitting chair and a table chair along with pen, paper and a phone. The website advertised a free bottle of water in your room, this was not provided. We also wasn't informed that the mini bars in the room had been deactivated so there was no supplied stock and no where to store any chilled items we may have brought with us. The TV was a bit of a let down, it had just over 10 standard definition aerial channels, if you were lying on your bed and was trying to watch one of the channels, you would struggle due to the poor picture quality. By the windows (last couple of pictures) we have clear evidence of mold and this was one of the biggest let downs of a radisson blu hotel, I expected this to be a non-existent problem in a 4 star hotel.. How this hotel is still 4 star baffles me.
The bathroom was quite modern with a nice sink, but again we had issues with mold being around the bath and shower area. On our first night we noticed that the adjustable shower head was broken so we couldn't change the setting and the temperature was either artic or desert (freezing cold, boiling hot), there was no Inbetween.

There was only one small pillow each in the room and no robes or slippers for the spa (as advertised). We asked nicely and were told that the hotel was too full for more than one pillow each (4 star hotel ?!?!) and that we simply could not have robes.

When it came time to leave they made a complete mess of the taxi booking. We asked for a taxi at the required time and gave almost 2 hours notice.

United Kingdom,Premium Room with River View,1  ,December 2018,Group," Paid £224.00 on a Sunday night for what was described as fantastic prior booking with great facilities etc etc. Well I was appalled at this hotel, firstly I paid £224 on a Sunday night, for the best room you could get (advertised as the best on booking.com) and it was no better than a travel lodge room worth £25, there was no windows that opened, there was a mini bar fridge with nothing in it and was turned off an had mold all in it so we couldn’t even put our own drinks in. The room was terrible it said we would have a river view hence the higher price, when really we had a steamed up window which over looked a building site. We was on the 5th floor and seen not even half the river due to cranes etc so we felt ripped off as we was in a less than standard room!! We then come to check out on Sunday and the lifts were broke so after waiting 15 minutes for a lift that never come we tried to find stairs down, well what a surprise we found stairs which took us to the basement and there was no way out, we had to walk half way back up and then walk to the lifts on another floor to get down. £224 is a small holiday for someone, we decided to splash out an go for the room that would make it special and it was abysmal, well over priced and I will never stay here again, not even so much as a complimentary bottle of water for £224.",4.6,Disappointing,0,price|restaurant|food/drink|location|bathroom|dirty|

A spilled drink remained on the bar / cafe floor for a good hour before anyone cleaned it up. The bar was not busy as it was early afternoon, so there was no excuse for the lack of service and the rudeness.The fact that the Reception staff seemed to be familiar with these two girls and their attitude and apologised to residents on their behalf as if they were well used to them. The man at the pool reception who said he could not give me slippers as they were running low. When I told him our room had only been stocked with one pair he made me leave the swimming pool reception and go and find housekeeping to get a pair.

When we got down we were told by one of the staff that the food had be sitting there ready... like it's room service for a reason, then we got a chicken salad that was full of fish which resulted in us not eating it.. I've never written a review before but I felt the need to this time as we saved up so hard to come here for my mams 50th birthday.

Bedroom was tired and dated, despite the fact that I had been upgraded to a Business class room.  No frills at all such as cushions, throws, pillow choices or nice decor which was disappointing as I paid a LOT of money for what was supposed to be a luxury weekend there.  Prices were high (more than double the normal rate) as it was a busy weekend in Liverpool but the hotel did not pay for any extra staff to deal with full capacity.  TV reception in bedroom was very poor and was never able to get BBC1 at all, mini fridge didn't work, wardrobe handles were loose. Breakfast was chaos - not enough staff, no cutlery, tables and serving areas a mess and ran out of several items of food and condiments. Spent the whole weekend gutted at the amount of money I paid to stay there. At the time of booking I had the choice of many cheaper hotels but chose this one for what I thought would be luxury. BIG mistake. I complained to the hotel at the time but they said they couldn't help as I'd booked through Booking.com. I complained to Booking.com, they e mailed the hotel but the hotel didn't bother to reply!  I will NEVER stay in a Radisson Blu hotel again. Utter disgrace.",4.6,"What a disappointment!

Despite this thry still advertise the room fridges.I had to throw away all our fruit which wrnt off overnight.heard other guests complain about this too.And the breakfast was very disappointing.We have always had lovely meat free breakfasts at other hotels.here despite the mention of fried eggs and scrambled, there were only scrambled on offer which were undercooked and runny.absolutely disgusting taste.there were no vegetarian/ quorn sausages available and no pastries/ croissants/ large cookies available as in other hotels with that rating.All this with a serving time only till 10.30 and no actual serving from staff who looked annoyed that most people choose not to have breakfast at 6 to convenience them.Add this to the heavily expensive parking available (26 pounds per day!) , very expensive massages at the spa and non working lifts, no spare pillows in rooms and no gowns/ slippers offered in spa.at nearly 300 for 2 nights we wish we had stayed in a budget hotel like premier inn or travelodge which were closer to the centre and had cheaper parking and better views.Not a patch on other similar rated hotels so avoid if you wany good value for money",5.0,Disappointing and overpriced with bad food.,0,location|bed|noisiness|food/drink|staff|comfort|price|parking|fitness|

United Kingdom,Standard Room,2  ,August 2018,Couple," Some minor equipment failures that should have been picked up and fixed but were not (missing cover on tea cabinet hinge in our room; loose coat hanger in a men's toilet cubicle on the ground floor; the loose bedside light in our room).  Also, maintenance tried and failed to fix the problem with a bedside light in our room.  These minor faults detract from the overall impression of what is a very nice hotel.
