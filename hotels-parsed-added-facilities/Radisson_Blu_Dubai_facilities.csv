At the check in Mr. Roshan ( Gent from Sri Lanka ) did a smooth check in which is the first rule of first impression for the Hotel. A BIG Thanks to Ms. Lyudmila ( FOM ) for Arranging the Perfect room which had an amazing view of the Burj ( 1309 to be Specific ).

Netherlands,Executive Room with Lounge Access,7  ,February 2020,Family,"¬†We stayed in this hotel for 7 nights. Booked executive room with access to the executive lounge. After our arrival there was a small miscommunication about additional bed for our daughter but the manager solved this perfectly!
Rooms are spacious and clean. Swimming pool is not too big but perfectly okay for a short swim (water very nice warm). Also for relaxing time the area is big enough.
Access to the business lounge is great. Between 17:00 and 19:00 food and drinks (alcohol included) for free. Breakfast here is also fine and quiet. 
The staff jn the business lounge is great and very helpful. My advice is to leave a small tip when you leave. Will be very much apriciated. 
If you need taxi take a regular one (just ask for it and staff will arrange one). The private taxis at the hotel are 2.5 time more expensive. 
Area is close to the down town (Burj Khalifa) = 15 Dirham by taxi = 10 minutes. To the La Mer beach = 25 Dirham = 15 minutes.  
To the Atlanis (Palm Beach) = 30 minutes = 70 Dirham.

The staff are incredible at all times everywhere from check in to check out. The room (1518) was functional in design yet pretty. Amenities great. The Burj view is a great bonus if it's your first time to Dubai. The Makar was a lovely upperclass pub vibe for the evening, and a fun quiz night (although the content too long and complex for us after a day of travel) was a bonus. The Fireroom restaurant has incredible views - excellent food too. The hot water did not work in our first room for a day (my husband having arrived before me for work), so when I arrived the following day I asked them to attend to sorting that out. There was an engineering issue being resolved after a pipe burst or something (not something they can control or pre-plan for, so I don't see it as a negative).

South Africa,Family Room,3  ,December 2019,Family,"¬†The room was exactly what we expected, very nice and spacious, as per the picture that was provided on Booking.com.  This is important for me because my expectations were met.  Our previous stay in a hotel in New York, did not meet our expectations as per the picture that they advertised and hence I had to lodge a grievance with regards to that.  So the picture of the room advertised must always be the room that the guest books.  You did this very well. Thank you.
The sleeper couch for my 2 boys was too small ie the room was advertised as a ""family room for 2 adults and 2 children"" and I provided details of my boys being 10 and 12 years old so the sleeper couch was too small for both of them.  But when I queried this, the hotel was happy to provide an extra bed without extra cost, which I appreciated.
The breakfast was nice and varied and we enjoyed experiencing the cultural variations.
The staff were most friendly, committed to service delivery and just wanted us to have a lovely stay.  We really appreciated that too.

We ate one dinner there and it was delicious.  We ate during happy hour out on the front on the patio-- bar area.  We had mussels which were both beautifully cooked and served.

Regina at reception was incredible, loved her and I have more names to mention. Everything was goin well, until the last night I was in the hotel, I got stolen exactly 270 Euros from a bunch of euros notes I had, sure the robber would think that I would not notice but I knew exactly how much I had after I had withdrawn the amount and left the euros untouched.
Found my stuff moved in different ways including my paperwork and reading book took a different location on my desk. Having OCDs and being a true traveler as well as an ex, Hotel Manager for the same company, Radisson, I realized right on the spot that things were not the same order as I always observe things. It took hours to get me count my money as I would have never thought something like this can even happen until I was packing to head to the airport and when was preparing all the tips in small envelopes, I realized my money was touched when I had the bigger bills on top of my smaller bills. I did not even want to believe at first, but it‚Äôs what it is, it had happened. 
Such a shame that one bad apple, ruined my vacation and left me so disappointed mostly when I know, my personal things have all been abused and touched including my underwear pocket.
The hotel promised they will investigate. Vanessa and James (Security and Guest Relations) were kind and helpful to come to my room at 3am before I packed for the airport and assured me things will be looked at. Until now, I have no feedback and I will be escalating this legally as I had personally called police and demanded for finger prints checking as well. Hoping I can get some feedback as I will feel much better to leave a better feedback for the hotel as if it was not for this experience, I would have had an incredible stay.",3.3,"Stolen money from my room!

Lastly (I thought this would be a bit obvious) there‚Äôs no list of important numbers to dial from your room to reach reception/service desk. So when we had to make the two late night calls, we just guessed and dialled zero.

Russia,Premium Room with Balcony and Burj Khalifa View,5  ,January 2021,Couple,"¬†When we arrived to the hotel we had 2 different booking reservations, since the extension was not possible via Booking. I have confirmed the same room with the hotel staff prior to check in and they assured me in writing that I will retain the room for the entire duration of my stay. However, when we arrived the receptionist asked again about the bookings and I had to explain from the beginning what was the issue. We checked in into our room and while the view was nice, the room itself was:
- Very old
- Dusty and not clean
One day when we came to the room in the afternoon after an exhausting day exploring the city, we found that our key was not working. In other words, we were simply locked out of our room. I then remembered that it was the day when we were supposed to ""check out"" according to our first booking. And indeed, when we arrived at the reception they acted like they had no idea about the second booking. And to make it even ""better"" now they were saying that our second booking featured a STANDARD room, while we were staying at the premium room with Burj Khalifa view. I was completely shocked by such incompetence. After 40 minutes of arguing the issue was resolved, but I sure didn't want to spend my time like this on holidays. I'd expect a free breakfast or at least a drink in return to such horrible treatment, and the hotel didn't offer a single thing.
As for the room service:
- Our bedsheets/bed linen were not changed the entire week

- At checkin-in the lady wasn't very kind, nor did she provide much info about the general things until we asked about them (which floor the breakfast is, which floor the pool is on, etc)
- We booked a room for 2 adults and 2 children. The sofa bed was not prepared, so we had to show our booking first that we had requested it before it was arranged. 
- We had luggage in the trunk of our renter car, as well as 1 piece of luggage on the backseat because it didn't fit. The only luggage brought to our room was the one from the back seat. Which is a human mistake that can happen. But then we were ready to leave, but had to wait an additional 20 min outside before they could take out the remaining luggage from our car. 
- Since they knew our booking was for 4 people, we found only 2 towels in the room. We complained and got 2 more towels. Then the next day we were again down to 2 towels. So we had to ask about it again. 
- The next day, the basic things such as shower gel, shampoo etc, weren't even refilled that were empty. The basic things you even get in a 3-star hotel could not be executed in this 5-star hotel. 
- We asked for a basic thin cover for our kids, because the one provided was one of those thick and warm fleece blankets. After 30 minutes waiting, a staff member shows up with the exact same blanket. I explain and show him that we already have that one, and that we would like a thinner one. Waiting another 15 minutes he just returns with the same one. 
- On our last evening we asked the reception if it would be possible to get a small package for breakfast, since we had to checkout the next morning at 5am. He said that it would be no problem, and it would be ready for us at checkout. Next morning, nothing was ready. And the staff member had to call the kitchen then to arrange it, and told us it would take 5 minutes.

United Kingdom,Standard Room,2  ,December 2020,Solo traveler,"¬†I had breakfast in The Larder and it was awful. It's buffet service and it feels like a race by the staff to get you served and out.  If you find everything you want to eat as you enter the ""Buffet area"" that's luck. Anything, other than the food displayed is ordered and takes a while - 15 mins for a fried egg. I could have had scrambled eggs, but fancied a fried egg - 15 mins later, it arrived, after I had eaten the rapidly cooling bacon and mushrooms... I left soon after with indigestion.  
This is a Business meeting / conference type hotel and not for tourists, unless you want to be quite close to the Shopping malls, Burj Khalifa, etc. It' also good for smokers in Makar - the Scottish Bar. Not great if you are a non smoker. I didn't see any other smoking areas in Dubai....!!
Fortunately, I had spent the previous 9 days at another hotel near the Marina and the contrast is unbelievable...

Regina at reception was incredible, loved her and I have more names to mention. Everything was goin well, until the last night I was in the hotel, I got stolen exactly 270 Euros from a bunch of euros notes I had, sure the robber would think that I would not notice but I knew exactly how much I had after I had withdrawn the amount and left the euros untouched.
Found my stuff moved in different ways including my paperwork and reading book took a different location on my desk. Having OCDs and being a true traveler as well as an ex, Hotel Manager for the same company, Radisson, I realized right on the spot that things were not the same order as I always observe things. It took hours to get me count my money as I would have never thought something like this can even happen until I was packing to head to the airport and when was preparing all the tips in small envelopes, I realized my money was touched when I had the bigger bills on top of my smaller bills. I did not even want to believe at first, but it‚Äôs what it is, it had happened. 
Such a shame that one bad apple, ruined my vacation and left me so disappointed mostly when I know, my personal things have all been abused and touched including my underwear pocket.
The hotel promised they will investigate. Vanessa and James (Security and Guest Relations) were kind and helpful to come to my room at 3am before I packed for the airport and assured me things will be looked at. Until now, I have no feedback and I will be escalating this legally as I had personally called police and demanded for finger prints checking as well.

During checking concierge told that there is no such room in hotel. So they had 3 weeks between booking and check in and nobody contact me to notify they may have problems with rooms. I come to hotel after night flight and I didn't want to argue with them. So I agreed to pay additional 30$ for night to get better room with extra bed. It wasn't my problem that they hadn't room I had booked but I still payed. The most disappointing fact that I paid and I didn't get my extra bed. I was waiting two nights. When I started arguing with manager I got my bed in ten minutes.

So tough noogies you missed the cleaning as they either clean at their convenient time or they will never clean. Furthermore, when they come up and clean, they do it improperly!
Room service is another disaster, the menu has little options and all of their food is old, but reheated! I could tell from the taste of the chicken and the old bread!
The reception guy was trying to convince me when I first arrived to upgrade my room and pay AED 900 but I refused then he gave me a lower price AED 700 but I refused again and then he told me that he got me a better and bigger room, but he gave me the worst room.

Belgium,Standard Room with Burj Khalifa View,4  ,February 2019,Solo traveler,"¬†I really don't like to criticize but this was by far my worst staying in a hotel. The service it is not a 5 Star hotel. I arrived at 2.30 am and my room , together with other 10 guests was not ready. They had a problem with their cleaning service, and the reception couldn't provide us information how long we need to wait. The hotel were proposing to go to another Radisson Blu hotel , which we had to pay, and for the taxi as well. Taking in consideration it was middle of the night and a lot of us had work the next morning, this was really annoying. Finally at 4am I could receive a standard room, and next day move to my initially booked room. I didn't receive any commercial gesture, just a juice with a note in my room as apology . 
The room wasn't 100% clean as I could see the dust under furniture. The cleaning lady forgot to put hands towels  the second day. 
The third day , I could see a dirty towel trolley next to my room , I thought it will be removed, but the next morning it was still there.
I don't want to be impolite, especially because I am member of Radisson hotels, and never experienced this, but for a 5 Star hotel, you cannot afford these little mistakes.

Netherlands,Standard Room with Burj Khalifa View,2  ,January 2019,Couple,"¬†Almost everything is bad. Not attentive service at the breakfast: they even offered me to drink coffee from a cup that has been used by someone else.
The room has not been made up despite us being away from the room from 11am till 5pm and having ""please make up room"" sign. So we didn't have fresh towels for our second night.
The window in the room was extremely dirty when we checked in so we had to clean it ourselves. There was also a coffee glass with clearly visible fingerprints as if it was never washed.
The location is just awful. It's kind of close to the metro but because there are construction everywhere and freeways you can't get there without a taxi.
The check-in clerk offered us a suite upgrade with Burj Khalifa view but the suite was actually a business meeting room (useless to us leisure travelers) attached to a bedroom and the Burj Khalifa was only visible from the meeting room and not from the bedroom. His price offer for the upgrade was also higher than publicly available price at the moment of upgrade and he refused even to match them. When confronted of all the problems we had during the stay on the check out he just said that he's sorry and it's not acceptable in a 5-star hotel; without offering any refund nor even waiving the upgrade fees (I'm used to Radisson Blu in other countries easily offering halving the cost of my stay when I have a minor hiccup and didn't even ask for a refund).

Sweden,Executive Room with Lounge Access,5  ,January 2019,Solo traveler,"¬†Couple of things: the communication between the room and room service:
Perhaps my misunderstanding but couple of times during my stay I was told that they will get back to me and somehow that part fell between the chairs. When asked about some information, they promised to get back to me but it could take some hours before feedback.
I did not like the fact that bedsheet was not changed during my entire stay, not even once. I stayed more than 5 nights. First two nights I locked myself into the room and I put up the not disturb sign. But afterwards, the room was cleaned 3 times during my stay and not once was the bedsheet changed.
I dont know why but I did not feel the warm welcoming look from some staff members couple of times which made me uneasy.
If arriving at breakfast at 10:45, first thing you heard was the stress tone the person had in their voice as if they wanted everyone to leave at 11:00 sharp. This happened to me when I just went down to get a banana due to the state I was in and then I heard this being said to another person two days later when I was heading out from the breakfast.
The staff members and their facial expressions and tone of their voice can make a large difference and unfortunately some staff members just made me feel very uneasy and very not welcomed.
When I was going to be visited by a male friend of mine: they told me that they will make an exception this once and will let him up to the room due to restrictions...but the same person on the phone could not answer me why my same friend was let up to my room without any problems a day earlier.
