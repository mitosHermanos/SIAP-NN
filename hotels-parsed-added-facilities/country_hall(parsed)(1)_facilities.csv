The hotel team were so friendly and helpful, they made us feel so welcome. The hotel was absolutely spotless and felt very safe with sanitiser everywhere and lots of signage to say what had been cleaned etc. 
The room was beyond comfortable, best bed I‚Äôve ever slept in! The view from our balcony of the London Eye and Houses of Parliament was phenomenal! 
Breakfast is served in the room due to social distancing. It came in disposable boxes with wooden cutlery. Whilst plates and regular cutlery would have been preferred, we understood why it was this way. The breakfast was still delicious and arrived hot and fresh.

The room was quiet and the bed really comfortable. The shower was absolutely fantastic! Even the minibar prices didn‚Äôt seem expensive after a day spent buying refreshments in museum cafes.
We didn‚Äôt intend to eat in the hotel restaurant, but the hotel runs a scheme giving you ¬£10 off a meal if you opt not to need chambermaid services the following day.

The Gatwick Express arrives at this station and the hotel is about a 200m walk from it. Staying South also helps with navigating the underground as most of the attractions is North of you. 
A simple stroll right onto the Southbank and into the centre of Westminister, a Marks and Spencer just around the corner and the beautiful double decker buses parked out in front give it a very pleasant feel. The hotel is very child friendly (many little perks to make your stay enjoyable.)

Finding transit from the PPCH was easy as it's very close to Waterloo Station, where you can catch a number of buses, trains and the tube.

United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,2  ,May 2019,Solo traveler,"¬†The restaurant and the Staff and the Head Chef.
I ordered a simple Steak and Chips. When it arrive with no presentation of garnish and just a pot of English Mustard and asked very nicely, could I get a sauce such as a B√©arnaise sauce? The Server looked at me blankly and said GRAVY? She went and asked the Chef and return with a NO, so I asked for French Mustard, they had none. She then came back again and said you did ask for Hollandaise? I said no and why would anyone ask for Hollandaise with a steak.
There were four people in the restaurant and your chef couldn't whisk two eggs, a dash of lemon juice and vinegar together? but they all can Che k their phones and have a laugh and push each other around in the kitchen in the view of me.
Also, if you ask for a Glass of white wine and ask for a second glass , I would expect there to be continuity in your glasses, two completely different glasses were given , with two different sized white wines in them??
I ask that you use staff who are the face of your hotel,  to have a basic knowledge and grasp of English and the menu.

The front desk staff at points were very rude and abrupt. English is not their first language and they struggle to communicate. Right from the check-in the promises were not delivered on. They would become very defensive if questioned about it treating one as if you‚Äôre a fool when they didn‚Äôt know and implement procedures correctly. 
The bar area is understaffed and on multiple occasions I had little to 0 service. On one weekend evening the bar was packed with only one bar tender serving the patrons. I waited more than 30 minutes to be served. This did not improve later in the week either. 
I got a sense that staff is not very happy at this venue which results in their abruptness. One chef at breakfast was specifically rude and disrespectful. I also witnessed him having issues with co-employees on multiple occasions. At one point he dropped a heated pan on the floor in the eating area. His reaction was very blas√©. Really not the kind of person you want to represent your business.

It has an open floor plan with a big open atrium in the middle and all rooms forming a circle around that space. The elevators have an open design and open up to this atrium as well with their backs.
The problem is, that the elevators make an extremely loud clanking noise whenever any of the 3 elevator moves. This would be tolerable if you could only hear this while using them, but since all rooms are facing them and there is a huge open atrium that magnifies this clanking noise you get to hear this noise from anywhere in your room, including your bed.
If you try to get to sleep at 11pm, good luck, it sounds like a person is standing in the front of your door clanking metal together every 10 seconds.

We have also had rooms at tropical temperatures with air con on max!

United Kingdom,Penthouse Suite (Family),1  ,September 2018,Couple,"¬†We paid over ¬£600 for a Penthouse apartment.  We stayed at the Park Plaza County Hall about 6 years ago for approx. 10 nights for our honeymoon.  The Penthouse was NO better and NO more glamourous than a normal room.  Do not waste your money on a Penthouse. 
The mini bar had an old packet of somebody elses opened olives in it and no other refreshments.  We paid a lot of money to stay in some luxury and did not get the treat away that we looked forward to and feel we deserved.  We have a 4, 3 and 2 year old children and this was a very rare opportunity for us to get way.  My husband wasted a good 50 minutes having to go back to the front desk to sort the prepayment of the bank card only to find the mini bar was empty anyway (apart from those lovely olives of course ) 
We also ordered some snacks in the form of calamari and chicken wings, both of which arrived cold and the calamari undercooked. Quite a poor show from a supposedly top class hotel. 
The d√©cor was very dated and the toilet pan was letting out quite a repulsive odour every time it was flushed.

The curtain to close this window is smaller than the window size, which means...you won‚Äôt be able to close it!

United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,1  ,August 2018,Couple,"¬†Had to queue for about 10 minutes to be seated for breakfast - very small seating area considering the size of the hotel. No cuttlery on the tables so some people were having to wait to eat until more was brought from the kitchen. Only 1 small coffee machine to use which dispensed 1 cup at a time, which meant another queue to get a cup of coffee. Surely jugs of filter coffee in addition to this would have made more sense, again for such a large hotel it was as if they were expecting hardly any guests for breakfast. By the time i got to eat my breakfast after queuing for a hot drink, it was cold! I wouldn't have been happy if i'd have paid separately for breakfast however on this occasion it did come with the room.
Over-all I don't feel the hotel stay was worth what i paid - ¬£242 for the night. I think you are probably paying for the location more than anything else! The room was a little disappointing even though it was supposedly an upgrade from a superior double to a executive room - i'm glad i didn't pay extra for this initially when booking. For the price paid i would have expected a much better standard and over-all experience.
