The hotel is modern, quiet, clean and located across from beautiful Vondel Park, which is a good location if you want to be a little outside the hustle of the touristy city center, but close enough to it.  It is close to museums, which are within a short walk (about 8-10 minutes).  Our family prefers to walk so walking distance is subjective.  The street train is super easy to catch and use. You can buy train tickets on the train (no cash, card only). Plenty of restaurants and a few shops nearby.  Beverages in the minibar were free but didn't have much in it (water, apple juice, and sparkling water).  The air conditioning and blackout curtains on remote control were lovely!

Taiwan,Superior Queen Room,1  ,January 2020,Couple, Everything remained wonderful until the moment we checked out on 27th noon.

United Kingdom,Superior Queen Room,3  ,February 2020,Family," We can’t fault the hotel itself, however we dined at TOZI on our first night and this restaurant seriously let’s down the branding and messaging of the hotel.
When we arrived we asked for a reservation at the restaurant for 6pm. The receptionist kindly took us to the restaurant reservations team where we were told it was totally fully booked. Even for 6pm they had zero tables available. Disappointed we headed back to our room, changed and went back down to try TOZI bar. We asked if it was possible to order something from the restaurant to eat in the bar. The very rude bar lady told us absolutely not - and instead offered us a table reluctantly in the restaurant. Upon arrival in the restaurant we looked around to find only 2 tables occupied. It was now 6.30pm. The atmosphere in the restaurant was hostile and pretentious, men in tweed suits prancing around doing nothing and dictating what and how we should order from the menu - there was sexism in the patronising way they spoke to us. The food was ok, although they need to work on their carbonara as it was actually pasta in a cheese fondu sauce which after a couple of mouthfuls was inedible. The lardons were also covered in pig hair. The wine was free poured instead of being bought to us by the glass. After a very disappointing dining experience we walked past the reservation screen and noted that half the table had not been reserved so why were we told it was fully booked? We would strongly urge hotel management to rethink its association with this restaurant.",9.0,"Beautiful and luxurious hotel, let down badly by its association with TOZI restaurant",1,0,restaurant|location|drink|staff|food|tv|

Turkey,Superior Queen Room,2  ,January 2020,Couple," We had a bit of an unpleasant situation. In the morning of our check out day, my partner and I were headed to the gym, when I realized, my AirPods were missing. After looking everywhere, I figured they were taken. My partner and I were traveling from Brussels, where I was for work. I retraced my steps. I clearly, had my AirPods with me when we left Brussels. And I remembered unpacking in Amsterdam, and seeing my pods in the pouch where I keep all of my cables (as any frequent traveler would I suppose). Before going downstairs, I asked my friend, who is the Guest Relations Manager at a five-star hotel, what is the general procedure. I then went down to speak with the reception. The person I spoke to was skeptical. Surely, that's her job to make sure, I was not making this up. When someone you never met, is doubting you, and your judgment, it is really hard to explain, that you are a responsible person, frequent traveler, and someone whose work is recognized internationally and that you would not make something like this up. She did inform the manager, who spoke to me shortly after. As we were checking out, the manager once again, approached me and said there will be a thorough investigation and that they would get back to me. I thanked the manager for the effort. And apologized for bringing this up, but I also had no other choice but to report the incident. Later in the evening, we noticed that my partner was also missing some cash. The reason we only noticed it then, was because it was our local currency. And since we were headed back home, we wanted to make sure we had enough cash for a taxi from the airport. Just as it was in my case, that pouch never left the room and he too was absolutely certain he arrived at the hotel with all the money in the pouch. I realize, this is why hotels have a safe but honestly, I thought it was a hotel with a reputational name to it!
