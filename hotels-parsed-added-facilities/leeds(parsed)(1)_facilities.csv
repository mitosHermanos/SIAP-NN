I spoke to reception and they upgraded us to a executive suite no extra cost. Once we entered the room it was cold no heating on so rung reception and a male member of staff came to the room and looked at the air con said should come on in 1/2 hour if not let them know. Im sorry but paying for a 4 star night away in a hotel not really going to sit waiting to see if it works. Me and my wife went out for food and drinks came back entered the room around 10.45pm guess what room was freezing back down to reception spoke to the gentlemen on the desk who came up to sort it out . Basically offered to move us again or could bring heaters to the room. by this time id had enough discussing this issue and went back to the room got in to bed fully clothed .

United Kingdom,Executive Double Room,1  ,August 2019,Solo traveler,"¬†I think it was the Executive room that I booked (322 square ft). I liked: space, wonderful value for money (when I booked), comfort, excellent breakfast, views from the top floor. Great air-conditioning, clean-smelling and cool on arrival. One of the best nights I've slept recently. Great bed. Duvet struck right balance between warmth and keeping cool, and was nice and soft. It was great being able to unwind so easily and effortlessly, even leaving the curtains open and having the lights of the city skyline gently glittering in. Well-insulated noise-wise - really, one gets a sense of getting above and away from all the hustle and bustle despite being at the heart of it all. Plush, soft carpeting in room. Nicely and classily fragranced reception. Good iron and ironing board. Shower excellent. Nice-smelling conditioner for hair. Good HD television and range of channels (Sky); the channels switch through very quickly, which isn't always the case.
I have to repeat that the breakfast is really good. Pancakes, waffles. Other items available to order. Poached egg could have been softer and more runny. The buffet breakfast is comfortably better than average. The sausages are particularly tasty. And on weekends, breakfast is open between 7 am and 11 am...quite a generous window. The decor is quite 'neon' and 'night club' if one doesn't mind, but it is a fusion restaurant during evening hours anyway.",10.0,Exceptional,1,price|comfort|food/drink|location|temperature|dirty|bed|noisiness|staff|bathroom|tv|internet|restaurant|

Stark without being trendy, only overhead lighting so if you shared a room and wanted to read, then your ovethead spotlight hit them too. The room was absolutely depressing and lower standard than Travelodge or other budget hotels. The staff were wonderful, but even the updated rooms were still too awful... so I refused ro stay there. I walked up the road to The Radisson and got a wonderful room for the same price! The Radisson receptionist said a man had done the ssme thing as me just the day before... had booked into the Plaza and refused to stay. Also... small thing, buy while I was in the Plaza room, a staff member brought a smallish bottle of water - at that point I was thinking of staying and asked for another because two of us were in the room... I was told they were only allowed to give us one. That's in a so-called 4* hotel.

The parking situation is also not the best as you have to walk about 7/8mins to the nearest car park.

Exta uncomfortable being that I am 7 months pregnant trying to negotiate a small cubicle! I Then I had to leave my husband and 3 year old daughter in the hotel reception. My 3 year old was already getting impatient and bored of waiting. She had already endured a 40 minute drive to get to Leeds. Many other customers arrived after us and were able to go straight through, which slightly bugged me too.
In the end my husband and child got into our room at 4.40pm. 1 hour 40 minutes after the room was supposed to be available. And over an hours wait from the time we arrived. They apologised and gave us a free breakfast in the morning but it didn't make up for spoilt plans and the mummy guilt of having to leave my child unsettled.
On another note, there was only one pillow for each of us in the room. At the minute I need 3 to have a good night's sleep. 2 for my head and one for the baby bump!

United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,3  ,September 2018,Family,"¬†I‚Äôve been coming here for a few years and usually everything is excellent but this year the room felt less clean and polished than previously, including a flickering light bulb which eventually failed and mould all over the bathroom sealant. Also, we returned on the second day to find that whilst the mugs and tea had been replaced and the bedding tidied the loo seat had been left up with urine in the bowl (which we did not do) and the glasses had not been replaced, as if someone had only half finished the tidy-up. Small things, but not nice to find someone else has used the toilet. 
We had asked for a travel cot for our 2 month old before arriving, but it came dirty and with a mattress like wood so we didn‚Äôt risk him in it, using our basinet instead.
The lifts were frequently being used by housekeeping services, making it difficult to fit the buggy in and they were literally falling apart with a wall panel missing from one of them.

But my last two stays one of the staff members have made my experience pretty difficult and i find him very rude and not pleasant at all. I had booked 3 separate rooms for 6 friends as we are aware we cannot stay in a room with more than 2 people so being sensible i had booked 3 rooms so we would not get in trouble. When paying for the 3rd room the staff member and security was making me and my friends feel very intimated saying if he finds out we are in a room with more than two people he would kick us out. There was no need for him to be rude and speak to us like this as we was sensible to book 3 rooms for 6 people therefore we would have gone on our night out and returns to our rooms and left at checkout the following morning. Also his security guards were very disrespectful to me and my friends for no reason when all we wanted to do was check in.
Now the second time i stayed was for a work occasion as i needed to book a place closest to Arlington offices whiterose park as i have meetings that following morning but due to covid i had gone back home which was in denton manchester so i got my employer to send me confirmation that it was a work reason for me to be staying at plaza i also rang the reception and a nice lady confirmed that with the confirmation from work i could go ahead and book in and show proof at reception so i booked it in. When i got there the lady was not there and again i had the same staff member who bullied me with his security last time serving me and my husband who had drove me 2 hours down from denton as i do not drive.

I also asked for extra towels as we traveled from London so didn't want to use the same towels in the evening and extra hot chocolate packets. They said it's fine will send it to our room later. Checked in no iron had to ask for one. Hair dryer wasn't working. We went out and then came back late to our room and they wasn't no towels or hot chocolate. I called up and then the guy was huffing and told me we can't have any bath towels extra I said I asked when we checked in and was told it was ok.

There should be a mirror by the door instead of only in the bathroom.
It would be nice to have an actually queen bed instead of pushing two single beds together. Me and my wife couldn't even sleep next to each other because we were sinking down the middle - we had to sleep as if we had our own individual single beds
The hotel was advertised to have parking. In actual fact, there was an independent car park they were associated with which means they do not have parking - so they shouldn't advertise the hotel as if it is their own.

United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,1  ,August 2020,Group,"¬†Check in was from 2pm. We checked in at 3.30pm had 2 rooms as we were 2 couples .  1 of our rooms wasn't ready, which was fine as we put all our bags in the room that was and due to sanitisation...we understood cleaning could take longer. We paid in full for both rooms when checking in. 
Then later in the day I got a call asking if I still required the 2nd room??? Well yes of course we do.....and we've paid for it! 
Then we came back to the hotel bar for drinks around 11.30pm. And had to explain to security why we only had 1 room card. We then got our 2nd room card after a little ordeal. 
When we went to the bar, the barman struggled to understand our order. His English wasn't the Best!! Gave us the wrong things! 
On our way to bed, i just asked the receptionist what time breakfast was......to then be told that we should have booked a breakfast slot?? Why wasn't we told this at check in?? At what point do you do this??  We got offered a 8.30am slot or 12pm. ? 
I wasn't happy as neither of these times were suitable! But more annoyed that we hadnt been told. Anyway eventually he managed to ""squeeze us in at 10.30am""  
I feel there was a breakdown in communication between reception staff And guests.   And I feel that the hotel was trying to let my allocated paid  room to someone else!!

The room was scruffy. The bathroom had someone else‚Äôs dark hair strewn over the shower knob. Dust everywhere. Curtains heavily stained. Room was claimed to be sanitised. I actually moved rooms Twice and was told I was unable to move rooms again, and was at first put into a disabled room which i found odd. 
The towels were scruffy and had evidence of someone else‚Äôs makeup and a brown colour of which I found out later was down to the special washing stuff the hotel uses on towels which turns blood to brown yeeuch. 
The bar was shut due to covoid so aquiring any tea coffee as a late arrival was out of the question, or even a bottle of water. I was 
 told Very promptly as a single person visiting and this is after 1130 at night, to go to the late night shop.  The provided kettle looked past its best with the obligatory coffee capsules also available but no cup to use apart from paper cups. Great for Covoid.
The lift doors partially opening between floors as it moved was a joy to behold so was some ominous looking guests. One of whom claimed they drove 500 miles from Kent to be in the hotel, and once spent 400 pounds on a suite at the park plaza in London per night, and that he Nearly planned to drive back this very evening 500 miles. 
The state of the hotel was blamed by the receptionist on Covid. I‚Äôm not so sure the virus should be blamed after staying there before many years previously.

I was unable to travel on the original booking date, as my town was flooded and we were under further potential risk and had to stay put.

Room was horrendous, tatty furniture, poor lighting, 1 wasn't even working, different end tables, ripped wall paper, dam on bathroom wall, TV was strange to operate and took some work. THEN, we went to order room service and was told its only pizza or sandwich and was told to go to like the 4th page of the menu, where i tiny writing it stated 24hrs. WELL, why not just have a separate menu from 11pm on wards with exactly what is available to order. Had no choice but to go to bed hungry in the end.
Not only on my 40th birthday was i home bound due to the flooding, but to top it all off, the hotel from customer service from the central reservation team/hotel prior to arriving to the stay, state of room, 24 hour room service...we had the worst stay ever, totally ruined my celebrations.

It is a central location so a little Saturday night noise on the street is understandable but not inside the hotel. 
I placed my breakfast order on the door the night before as instructed, but it hadn't been collected, so needed to call reception but no phone, I found it on the floor, it was prehistoric and dirty (however it did work) once I paired it to one of the many plug sockets. The English breakfast when it arrived (room service lady was very polite and apologetic about the night staff not picking it up from my door handle the evening before) was worse than a motorway breakfast from the 70's it was vile processed rubbish. 
The hotel entrance was behind boarding and scaffolding so I assume it is undergoing a refurb, I hope this extends to all the rooms, it needs to, the whole experience was like travelling back in time.

United Kingdom,Superior Twin Room,1  ,August 2019,Family,"¬†Room wasn't very clean, I found evidence of very poor attention to detail (with the cardboard inside of a toilet roll stuffed down once side of the basin) so obviously missed by the cleaner and indicative potentially of other 'misses' in cleanliness. Also there was an unidentifiable brown stain on one of the apparently unused and 'clean' bath towels (I think it was makeup but could have been anything - dried faeces, blood). So towel not clean. Not pleasant, and my immediate request to reception for a replacement, which was received with a 'yes of course' elicited no apology and actually never arrived! Bed pillows uncomfortable. Adding insult to injury I was asked by the security guys in reception, as I returned back in the evening after a night at a concert in Roundhay Park (which was muddy and I was wearing wellington boots) to remove my boots. I had been elsewhere, the mud was dry, I'd purposefully banged my feet to remove residue outside. I was gobsmacked they held up a bin bag to put my boots in. I refused to walk through reception, into the lift and along the corridor to my room in my socks. If the Management had provided, say, slip over elasticated boot covers I would have happily complied but frankly from a health and safety point of view this management decision was very poor. Moreover it was frankly insulting and poorly executed - at ¬£334 for 1 night I felt that a little bit of mud on their carpets was a managemeable feat for them to handle and suck up. I 'got' the purpose of the request but it was poorly managed. The hotel, in my view, and I've stayed in plenty over the world and lots in Leeds in particular was that this hotel is all 'fur and no knickers' (glitzy reception but poor standard of rooms, bedding, cleaning, staff training needs addressing in areas) and quite possibly the worst place I've stayed in in Leeds centre.",4.2,"Overpriced and below par on many levels - cleanliness, comfort, management",0,dirty|bathroom|noisiness|staff|bed|location|

Also the drink vouchers were only for wine/beer which we don‚Äôt drink. Subsequently when we put our daughter to bed in the sofa bed, it collapsed. On inspection the lats had come loose and the metal bar was snapped and looked as though it had been temporarily fixed! The duvet cover also had a stain on.
