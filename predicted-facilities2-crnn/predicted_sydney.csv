Fine.
Then after everything was solved, no thank to the concierge, he decided to move from his desk and approach me in the waiting area to inform me that concierge and reception are two different things and that he cannot pass messages on (3m to his right).

He then went on to lecturer me the difference between a concierge and reception and that ""I might not be able to COMPREHEND the difference""

As an international pilot, I assure you I can comprehend the difference and in fact I am very familiar with a far more impressive service than yours.

3209,United Kingdom,Standard Double Room - Atrium View,1,June 2020,Couple," At reception they couldn't find my booking and were rather abrupt in dealing with the situation, which was in fact their own administrative error. Anyway, that aside, having paid a reasonable amount for the accomodation, we were excited to be offered an upgraded to a superior twin double room, from a standard double room. The reception told us this room would be more spacious and we (as a couple) could just choose which bed to sleep in, as it had two double bed. Unfortunately, the beds were pretty small doubles, so I can only imagine they were smaller than the standard double room bed size, which is understandable if one person is anticipated to sleep in each bed, but as a couple, I don't know if this was really a good upgrade to have been given. Additionally, there was loud music playing until the early hours of the morning, which didn't help with obtaining a comfortable nights sleep. In the morning, we had also paid for breakfast to be included. On making our way to the breakfast room we were taken to a table and given a menu with priced item, no explanation. After being left for a considerable amount of time, the same waiter came back and asked if we'd been served. We proceeded to ask about the breakfast, being understanding that buffet style is not suitable in the current global situation, but being a little confused having been given a menu with different prices and options and not knowing what exactly our prepayment entitled us to. Once explained we ordered from the menu as directed, however the resulting dishes were disappointing at most. With a very small offering to begin with, you'd hope the dishes were at least worthy of their spot on the menu. However, the orange juice (priced on the menu at $7, one glass of which was included in our breakfast allowance) was very poor quality and came in a very small glass.",7.0,Night Away,0,staff,1
