It feels as if you are in the heart of everything. The hotel is approx 5min away from the train station. Close to all restaurants and shops. It was lovely that the hotel had a sauna and a pool. There was even a ice machine in the hotel. When you went in and out from the hotel there was a place where you could get some water for free, that was nice. Even if the hotel is in the middle of everything, I appreciated it that the hotel was somewhat sound proof. You could hear people from next door going in and out but that was it. No sound from the traffic or anything, which was nice. The staff are very customer service oriented and were attentive. Awesome that there was a minibar in the room. I loved that you could use a hand control to control everything in the room. You didn't need to get out of bed to example turn off the lights or the AC etc. Overall the best thing about this hotel is the excellent location.

We arrived by train from Brussel and the hotel is in-front of the Centraal Station, you can see it clearly. The next day, we took excursion to Zaanse Schans Windmill and meeting point was at Central station. It made this hotel as a perfect choice for us. We also took the small boat cruise where the meeting point was at Anne Frank house, its <10 mins walk from the hotel. The Dam Square and red light district are all walking distance. There are 2 Malaysian restaurant nearby (Wau and Nyonya), where we feel like home. I would rate 10 for location.
The concierge personnel was very nice and polite. We opt for Van Gaugh museum & hardrock café and decided to take a taxi from the hotel despite the suggestion from him was a tram. We realized the taxi was a bit pricey (>20 Euro for one way). The hotel provide luggage storage and washroom for refreshing if your flight/train leave later in the evening, but make sure you ask for toilet key from front desk.

Our second room was clean with a great bathroom (walk-in shower) Additional requests in correspondence were ignored and late check out was not possible as that can't be pre-arranged unless you are willing to pay for an extra night or win the room lottery on the day you check out to be one of the lucky 2 rooms for a late check out.

The staff couldn’t have been more helpful and and room was lovely and the shower was probably the best shower I’ve ever had with a massage spray setting on it.

Right by the canal tours and central station, just opposite the main tram stops. Very close to Red Light District. Very close to fast food like subway, McDonald's, kfc, FEBO. Also very near to a traditional Dutch fries store which was amazing. The staff were SO lovely! On one occasion the lovely receptionist asked my boyfriend and I what our plans were for the day, we said we were off to the Moco Museum aka Banksy exhibit and the lovely gentleman booked our tickets for us there and then, then when we got to the museum we could skip the long queue thanks to the lovely gentleman on the desk! Checking in was easy, checking out was even easier! 24 hour reception is great for funny flight times like ours! There's a lovely lounge/bar, a very modern stylish gym, and a pool that's to die for after a long day of exploring! The rooms were wonderful, elmis products in the bathroom!

We tried to confirm with them that if all the rooms are same sized, and they lied by saying ‘yes’. How terrible and horrible are they, trying to rip customers off.

3079,United Kingdom,Superior King Room,3,August 2020,Couple, As it was my partners b day I asked for an upgrade to an executive king room. This was confirmed. Shortly before we departed for Amsterdam I asked them to reconfirm as it was a surprise. Again I was told not a problem. Arrived at the hotel  and a bit of a wait even though there were 4 staff on the front desk they seemed to be slow getting guests  checked in. We went to the room we had allocated to us only to find it was the original room we booked. The lady at the front desk made it seem as though it was my fault for not confirming again at the front desk on arrival even though I had twice by email. Eventually she offered a free room upgrade but the moment had passed for the birthday surprise so we stuck with our original room which was nice enough. The pool changing rooms were closed due to COVID so it was a case of going back to you room wrapped in a towel if you didn’t what to change in front of people. Pool was nice but the filters were really dirty inside a could have done with a clean. Due to COVID we were told the the cleaning staff wouldn’t clean the room unless requested. We requested at the front desk the next morning but no one came. Finally went to concierge as we had no fresh towels soaps or hair shampoo and literally had to beg to have someone clean the room as he said we’d now missed the cut off time for requesting the room cleaned. All in all this is a lovely hotel but is let down hugely by its front desk staff unfortunately.,7.0,Lovely hotel great location. Front desk staff lacking though,0,staff,0

The picture of the room on booking.com looked much bigger ( there were 3 of us and looking through the photos now not sure got the room we paid for) and showed rooms with large windows - or 3 sets of french doors even -that started lower to the ground with lots of light and amazing views. The room we got had one set of windows up higher from the floor which were not easily accessible because the sofa bed was up against that wall where the window was - when we tried to open them (while standing on the sofa bed)  they had a safety restraint and opened only so far. Fair enough we thought - safety first -  So we tried to put our phone out the gap of the window to take a photo of this Iconic View and noticed there was black safety mesh net all over he outside of the building so we couldn't properly see the Iconic view or even take a picture of it through the mesh. If you are going to charge extra or even put that in the statement line in the information don't you think you should be able to see it unemcumbered?

4151,Bahrain,Executive King Room,3,November 2019,Solo traveler," I pre-paid for a 3 day stay of an Executive King Room with Balcony & Bathtub vía booking.com , I chose the hotel based on that criteria, but when I got there, the non-refundable room I pre-paid for was not available.
I was asked to show the confirmation as they only have 2 rooms in the whole hotel that match that criteria, I was even told that I needed to contact the property before hand to request the balcony and the bathtub even though I had written confirmation about the room features.
So I showed how in my confirmation it was clearly stated that the Executive King Room had those features, I was told “No, those are just the hotel features” which I replied these are clearly the room features as is under the Room features tab to what the staff member agreed.
When I did the check in the receptionist assured me my room had the balcony and the bathtub as I asked before signing the check in form, so when I go up and I see no balcony I was angry...
Had to come down again and had to ask to speak to the manager, then I was told the balcony does not open anyways due to safety reasons so its the same as having a window....what kind of answer that?!
I was told I was lucky as they have found a room with a bathtub and a view and that was an “upgrade” because this room had a view even though it did not have the advertised balcony. (Room 137)
Obviously by now I’m getting more and more angry , thinking why did I choose to book in this hotel where I’m being charged +600 euros for a 3 day stay and not even getting what is advertised.
After a lot of pushing the manager came and I was finally shown and offered the twin room (2 small beds) with balcony & bathtub which was significantly smaller and did not take it.
I paid for THE king size bed, THE balcony and THE bathtub and that’s  what I expected to receive upon my arrival.

I was asked to show the confirmation as they only have 2 rooms in the whole hotel that match that criteria, I was even told that I needed to contact the property before hand to request the balcony and the bathtub even though I had written confirmation about the room features.
So I showed how in my confirmation it was clearly stated that the Executive King Room had those features, I was told “No, those are just the hotel features” which I replied these are clearly the room features as is under the Room features tab to what the staff member agreed.
When I did the check in the receptionist assured me my room had the balcony and the bathtub as I asked before signing the check in form, so when I go up and I see no balcony I was angry...
Had to come down again and had to ask to speak to the manager, then I was told the balcony does not open anyways due to safety reasons so its the same as having a window....what kind of answer that?!
I was told I was lucky as they have found a room with a bathtub and a view and that was an “upgrade” because this room had a view even though it did not have the advertised balcony. (Room 137)
Obviously by now I’m getting more and more angry , thinking why did I choose to book in this hotel where I’m being charged +600 euros for a 3 day stay and not even getting what is advertised.
After a lot of pushing the manager came and I was finally shown and offered the twin room (2 small beds) with balcony & bathtub which was significantly smaller and did not take it.
I paid for THE king size bed, THE balcony and THE bathtub and that’s  what I expected to receive upon my arrival.

4244,United States of America,Superior King Room,1,September 2019,Couple," Having said that, some comments:
1.	 Regarding high tech, the person bringing our luggage to our room could have spent more time explaining how the TV works.  We had great difficulty understanding all the prompts and controls on the TV remote.  And of course, the TV remote indicated a low battery level.  Maybe that created some of our difficulty whenever we pressed a button expecting it to work.  Hence, never really watched TV.

The receptionist has called the restaurant to correct the mistake but we were forced to stay again in the line to enter the restarant and to be seated. The seating process is very chaotic. 
4. Long lines at the buffet. The staff was not wearing gloves adding cheese and other food to the buffet barehanded.
5. The towels in the bathroom were dirty!!!
