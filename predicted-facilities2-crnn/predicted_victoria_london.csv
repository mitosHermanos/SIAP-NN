Over the past 2 years of staying at Park Plaza I've started to notice many little inconveniences and quality issues arise. Things like, missing battery covers on tv remotes, wifi that doesn't work in some rooms, a terrible odor coming from the bathroom, showers that flood bathroom floors, and a few other things.

Our one-bedroom apartment (almost 350 pounds a night) could have been good if re-furbished, but it was in an appalling state of disrepair, with cupboard doors and drawers chipped and mal-aligned, a non-working dishwasher, large gouges out of the wooden floor (and parts of it that had lifted off completely), doors that didn't shut properly, a pungent and sickening influx of onion and garlic cooking smells several times a day, tatty furniture, no table to eat at, missing and mis-matched cutlery - the list goes on! The advertised coffee pods were not replaced each day (until we asked), and our bathrobes were removed during cleaning on the second day and had to be retrieved. The housekeeping was perfunctory and erratic. An extra 12.5% was added to our room service bill (not mentioned in the menu) and the quality of the food was mediocre. We took friends to the hotel's breakfast on one morning, and it was embarrassing - tired quintessential English greasy (and cold) hot dishes (one slice or two of congealed scrambled eggs? - with slightly exotic dishes such as eggs benedict or espresso coffee an extra cost). We reported the non-working dishwasher and onion smells to housekeeping and were assured that ""maintenance"" would look at it, but nothing happened.
All of this might have been predictable and tolerable had we been paying a third of the tariff we were charged, but it was unacceptble for the price.

Their logic was that ""it is how it works"" !!: To charge the customers on the check-out day! Nonsense! As if they have the only hotel in the world and people have not seen other hotels before. 
The price in Pounds, however, was the same, but the important point was that we chose the option of Euro, for a certain amount,  and just that certain amount, not more. People call it a ""deal"". Apparently they do not care about this term in this hotel with their payment policy!
Furthermore,  they booked 50 pounds from our credit card for the stuff in the mini bar,  that's okay, but then put something in it too!

I asked why I wasn't told this before and the reply was I thought that was obvious!! I then phoned room service and luckily spoke with PK who was genuinely apologetic and within 5 minutes he brought me a plate of biscuits. I strongly recommend PK is upgraded to staff trainer as he seems to be the only member of staff that can appreciate the situation from a client's viewpoint!!,6.7,Staff need to be trained to be more positive towards clients!,0,food/drink,0

I gave him mine and asked what will he do with it and he said he won't take any money from it, it is only the guarantee we will pay for our stay. Next, I checked my bank account and it showed that the hotel took amount of money for 2 nights (including the deposit). I complained to another receptionist and she said the money isn't taken but ""frozen"".  Next thing, my friend's father informed her that the hotel called him on his phone and asked if he wants to pay for the rest 2 nights with that same card (the one we used for first night and the one they didn't want to take for pre-authorization) and he refused, because he knew they already have frozen our money. On Sunday we went to inform the reception about this behaviour and that we are shocked that you have guests in your hotel willing to pay, and you refuse it and then call someone who isn't there at all to pay. We explained everything all over again to another receptionist, and she apologized and asked if we want to pay now and I agreed. They said they will make the payment from frozen amount of money, but they took ANOTHER amount of money from my card which means I paid DOUBLE. I complained again to the chief desk officer and she said she will talk to accountant first thing on Monday to release the money and it will be in 3-5 working days back.

Few issues with room (wont go into them as they are not the reason for the poor review) which where minor. The real issue was, despite reporting the issues 3 times, they where not dealt with.
This appeared to me to be a staff problem more than an hotel problem.
The follow up resolution was excellent and what we would have expected.
I have taken a couple of weeks to reflect as sometimes spontaneous reviews are never a true reflection of a stay and it is important to point out the positives, breakfast as usual excellent, reception staff very good and follow up to problems was excellent.

We stayed in a spacious one bedroom suite, with self-catering facilities. However, the carpets were filthy and torn/threadbare, the wooden floor in the lounge area was heavily damaged, the dishwasher didn't work (and wasn't fixed in the four days we stayed after reporting this) some light globes needed replacing, the furniture was very knocked about and internal doors were heavy to open and shut. The blind for the bathroom window was broken and the washbasin sprayed water in all directions (again, not attended to even though we had asked for it to be fixed). We needed to ask for sugar sachets (twice). Staff were friendly, but for most English was clearly their second language, and we suspect that some things just got lost in translation. What could have been an exceptional hotel (it has all the basics) was a little Fawlty Tower-ish in some aspects.

not like housekeeping, as we were there for five nights we agreed only
one, we were given a voucher worth £10 per room for money off our lounge

cleaned twice and that was after we called reception to report there had
been no housekeeping done! As for the voucher you would think that would

The bathroom needs renovation, the mirrors show large areas of rust. The shower cabin was severely leaking so the bathroom was flooded after each shower. 
There were no spots to hang the towels. There was no power outlet near a mirror, so using a blow dryer was kind of impossible.

The cleaners knocked 3 times in the morning asking what time did we check out from 10:30 this happened when check out is at 12!
It was meant to be a chilled morning as we have young kids we wanted to make the most of the time to ourselves.! This was extremely annoying!!!
Also the lift for the car park was a joke just waiting for ages for them to open.
And then when you get to the car park downstairs it's like a car boot sale.

4190,United States of America,Superior Double Room,6,August 2018,Solo traveler," The location was the only good thing about this hotel. But here are some bad things that I have experienced during my stay at this hotel. First night: I was in a room on the third floor. The room and furniture were literally shaking and about to collapse whenever the door in the next room was opened and closed, like an earthquake. I asked them to change it and they did, and believe or not, they said it’s so common in their hotel to hear from residents about the doors problem. Second issue: After three nights, I decided to extend my stay due to a flight change, so the hotel pre-charged my credit card 5 times during my stay!! (Before the check out time!) totally charged me for more than a double of the whole total amount of the stay. When I complained and met the duty manager, he said there is an error in the system !! And to be honest he didn’t say the truth cuz these transactions are done manually. I asked them to hold the whole amount for the stay just once, and release the rest of holding money that they hold without any reason or right! He said apologized about what happened and said okay but he didn’t know when these amount supposed to get back to my card, therefore, I was so limited financially on my card until the time of writing this comments. Third issue, with the bed: the cover sheet and pillows’ sheets smell bad, they smell like a forgotten wet towel on the couch for days without getting it dried. I asked them to change them all, the did in the next day!! Third issue: they don’t put a new bag and form for the laundry again in the closet it you already used them. So you have to call every time to ask them to bring a bad & form to put in the closet in order to use them next time. Honestly, this is NOT a good hotel to stay at when you come to London whether for a vacation or business trip!",5.4,Fair,0,location,0
