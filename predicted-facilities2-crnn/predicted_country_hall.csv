United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,1,November 2019,Solo traveler, The location was perfect for my trip to the South Bank. The actual siting of the Hotel was not as attractive as others in the vicinity (on a roundabout overlooking Waterloo) but as i was only staying the night this did not worry me. Staff were super friendly & helpful & made me feel very welcome. Which is always important as a lone traveler. The room was upgraded to a suite on the 8th floor which was very comfortable & compact with a small kitchenette. As the evening was atrocious weather wise i intended to dine in my room so this was a welcome upgrade. Door personnel & porters were very attentive & nothing was too much trouble. Check out was fast & efficient despite the lobby being busy.,9.0,Super Friendly & Modern Hotel in good location for South Bank events,1,location,0

The room was quiet and the bed really comfortable. The shower was absolutely fantastic! Even the minibar prices didn’t seem expensive after a day spent buying refreshments in museum cafes.
We didn’t intend to eat in the hotel restaurant, but the hotel runs a scheme giving you £10 off a meal if you opt not to need chambermaid services the following day.

Finding transit from the PPCH was easy as it's very close to Waterloo Station, where you can catch a number of buses, trains and the tube.
The layout of our room (u-shaped, with a bathroom and kitchenette in the middle) made it easy to share the space with my friend while still maintaining a degree of privacy. I also made a special request to surprise my friend and the staff went above and beyond to help me out. They even left a sweet and very heartfelt card for us, which we really appreciated.",8.8,Well furnished and location can't be beat,1,staff,1

Or add in a couple of sausages and beans, still worth only half of that. Also I've never had to queue for a breakfast table in any restaurant I've stayed in throughout the world, crammed into a small corridor outside the lifts.

There were four people in the restaurant and your chef couldn't whisk two eggs, a dash of lemon juice and vinegar together? but they all can Che k their phones and have a laugh and push each other around in the kitchen in the view of me.

South Africa,Studio Double (Family),9,December 2018,Family," I found the staff not well-trained, miscommunicating and contradictory. 
The front desk staff at points were very rude and abrupt. English is not their first language and they struggle to communicate. Right from the check-in the promises were not delivered on. They would become very defensive if questioned about it treating one as if you’re a fool when they didn’t know and implement procedures correctly. 
The bar area is understaffed and on multiple occasions I had little to 0 service. On one weekend evening the bar was packed with only one bar tender serving the patrons. I waited more than 30 minutes to be served. This did not improve later in the week either. 
I got a sense that staff is not very happy at this venue which results in their abruptness. One chef at breakfast was specifically rude and disrespectful. I also witnessed him having issues with co-employees on multiple occasions. At one point he dropped a heated pan on the floor in the eating area. His reaction was very blasé. Really not the kind of person you want to represent your business.

I kept an eye on this person throughout the all dinner and his attitude did not change.

United States of America,Junior Suite (3 Adults),2,November 2020,Family," I've stayed at Park Plaza County Hall many times (daughter attends Evelina childrens hospital) and this is so close and I feel safe walking between the hotel and hospital even late at night. I've always been  pleased with our stays.  This trip I chose to pay more for a junior suite as stated there was a dining area which with restaurants closed would have been better when travelling with children.  There was no dining area and I didn't get very far when I tried to change rooms (back to a cheaper room!) - they were very lovely of the phone though!!  This was an older style room in need of refurbishment I.e rust around taps etc.  The cold tap ran warm in the kitchen and bathroom sink and the water pressure in the shower was really low.  I guess because of Covid restrictions there were no plates/cutlery etc.  I was very disappointed as I paid almost £100 more and wished I just booked a regular room. This hasn't put me off though, I'll just be mindful next time and better the devil you know!!",5.0,Fair,0,price,0

Germany,Executive Family Studio with London Eye View,8,February 2020,Couple," This hotel has one giant problem. It has an open floor plan with a big open atrium in the middle and all rooms forming a circle around that space. The elevators have an open design and open up to this atrium as well with their backs.
The problem is, that the elevators make an extremely loud clanking noise whenever any of the 3 elevator moves. This would be tolerable if you could only hear this while using them, but since all rooms are facing them and there is a huge open atrium that magnifies this clanking noise you get to hear this noise from anywhere in your room, including your bed.
If you try to get to sleep at 11pm, good luck, it sounds like a person is standing in the front of your door clanking metal together every 10 seconds. 
We were only able to get to sleep with earplugs in, which is totally unacceptable for a hotel in this price range. 
Providing a quite environment at least at night is one of the bare necessities a hotel should provide.

Germany,Executive Family Studio with London Eye View,8,February 2020,Couple," This hotel has one giant problem. It has an open floor plan with a big open atrium in the middle and all rooms forming a circle around that space. The elevators have an open design and open up to this atrium as well with their backs.
The problem is, that the elevators make an extremely loud clanking noise whenever any of the 3 elevator moves. This would be tolerable if you could only hear this while using them, but since all rooms are facing them and there is a huge open atrium that magnifies this clanking noise you get to hear this noise from anywhere in your room, including your bed.
If you try to get to sleep at 11pm, good luck, it sounds like a person is standing in the front of your door clanking metal together every 10 seconds.

United Kingdom,Superior Double Room with London Eye View,1,November 2019,Couple," The staff guy who served us on the check in was not very welcoming, he had this rude face. And he gave us a room number 1201 , as soon as we entered the room it looked 10 times worse than these hotel rooms that you can  get for about £90 and we paid £212 for 1 night and It looked nothing like on the pictures that were shown. Then we went to reception to talk about this , this time we went to this other staff guy as we didn’t want to be served by the guy who checked us in at first. So this second staff guy was trying to convince us to say the room is very nice , and he has looked at the room himself but as we weren’t happy so he showed us this other room 1101 and the room was a lot better actually like it was shown on the pictures. And I am glad he changed the room for us otherwise I was going to ask for a refund as it was very disappointing and misleading. And also I wonder if that guy who checked us in actually gave us that room on purpose as he didn’t look happy in himself so he took the frustration out on customers by making them unhappy.",5.0,Fair,0,staff,0

United Kingdom,Executive Studio - City View,2,September 2019,Family, The staff need training in social skills. The lady that checked us in didn’t look like she wanted to be there barely a smile to great us also didn’t know pool price for sister hotel and didn’t bother checking. Same lady checked us out and same I asked do we collect car from valet at sister hotel opposite had a nod of yes and didn’t even check for us. Got to valet at other hotel and car wasn’t there !! we paid a lot for this service aswell. There was no signage to show us how or where to go to park for the valet ended driving around in circles before we took wrong entrance and told we would get a ticket.

The restaurant was totally inadequate for the number of guests at breakfast. Staff rushed around heroically trying to clear tables but it felt like being in a busy motorway service station. The guy who made me an omelette looked at me as though I’d asked him to skin his pet rabbit.
The bath was blocked.
We left sonething in the room but it would appear that it was stolen by cleaning staff because when we called the hotel they confirmed that it had not been handed in.

United Kingdom,Junior Suite (2 Adults),2,June 2019,Couple," We have stayed in this Hotel many times but not for a few years, sadly the breakfast and breakfast staff were not as we remembered, the coffee arrived after we had eaten our warm food despite several reminders, I say warm as the food was not actually hot (except the eggs which were cooked in front of you.) think the hot plates need maintenance. 
Despite asking for a high floor as it was my husband's  80th birthday (we booked a Junior Suite) we were on the lowest floor for that room category (8th) so had a lovely view of the building opposite and half the London Eye.

No orange juice???? 
The bar staff downstairs are not customer focused, had to stand and wait for drinks, always doing paperwork and you end up just walking away.

Kuwait,Junior Suite (2 Adults),3,January 2019,Couple," I booked the junior suite with the partial view of the London eye 8 months before New Years to guarantee a good spot for the fireworks. I was emailed a day before my free cancellation date saying I’m not guaranteed even partial view of the London eye, and if I wanted an upgrade to partial view suites (which, to my knowledge,I had already booked for around £2000 for 3 nights!!!) I had to pay double the price since it was New Years!! ( around £4000 to see partial view) Upon arrival I realized the whole thing was a complete scam with false advertising & the ladies at the reception became quite defensive and wanted hands-off on the matter claiming “they’re only working there and they’re not to be held countable”. 
I requested to speak to the manager who didn’t want to do much first but after seeing how upset I was in the reception, barking “false advertising” and uncovering shameful reality I was finally given the chance to cancel my booking (which was made impossible at first). 
The manager became softer towards the end and even called us a cab. After 8 months of planning We were left completely devastated & disappointed in putting our trust in this hotel!! I just ask that you please post pictures that correctly convey the reality of the room one selects and that you do not opt for false advertising to make a few more pounds off of tourists who are just here to enjoy themselves under your trust.",3.3,Poor,0,location,1

The room service food was absolutely awful, just the worse I have ever had. Breakfast wasn’t much better - surly chef who used hands for the ingredients for the omelette making rather than spoons, the waiting area for eggs was also not well organised as it prevented others getting to the buffet. Lack of bread and roll choices for breakfast. The seating was also very unorganised as we were made to wait when there were plenty of free tables. Continued to watch this debacle when I sat down surrounded by empty tables while they may people queue for breakfast unnecessarily. Bath shower combination meant you had to climb into the shower. Not a nice view from the room and could hear noise from other guests in the corridor when in room. Clattering from the breakfast area on the ground floor travelled to through the central courtyard and woke you up early. Nowhere outside for drop off by taxi or car and the nearby car park has no lift if you have a heavy case.

United Kingdom,Studio Double (Family),3,October 2018,Solo traveler," Breakfast was a bit of a shambles each day. Breakfast room seems too small for number of guests. 
Unimpressed by reception chap when I asked about potential later checkout. Rather than actually checking if it was available, he spent time telling me how much it would cost and asking if I was happy with that, to which I agreed...before even looking to check availability. Eventually, he told me that it wasn't available anyway. Small point maybe, but it gives an impression of not engaging brain.",6.7,"Good accommodation, but breakfast is a scrum.

United Kingdom,Penthouse Suite (Family),1,September 2018,Couple," We paid over £600 for a Penthouse apartment.  We stayed at the Park Plaza County Hall about 6 years ago for approx. 10 nights for our honeymoon.  The Penthouse was NO better and NO more glamourous than a normal room.  Do not waste your money on a Penthouse. 
The mini bar had an old packet of somebody elses opened olives in it and no other refreshments.  We paid a lot of money to stay in some luxury and did not get the treat away that we looked forward to and feel we deserved.  We have a 4, 3 and 2 year old children and this was a very rare opportunity for us to get way.  My husband wasted a good 50 minutes having to go back to the front desk to sort the prepayment of the bank card only to find the mini bar was empty anyway (apart from those lovely olives of course ) 
We also ordered some snacks in the form of calamari and chicken wings, both of which arrived cold and the calamari undercooked. Quite a poor show from a supposedly top class hotel. 
The décor was very dated and the toilet pan was letting out quite a repulsive odour every time it was flushed.

United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,1,August 2018,Couple," Had to queue for about 10 minutes to be seated for breakfast - very small seating area considering the size of the hotel. No cuttlery on the tables so some people were having to wait to eat until more was brought from the kitchen. Only 1 small coffee machine to use which dispensed 1 cup at a time, which meant another queue to get a cup of coffee. Surely jugs of filter coffee in addition to this would have made more sense, again for such a large hotel it was as if they were expecting hardly any guests for breakfast. By the time i got to eat my breakfast after queuing for a hot drink, it was cold! I wouldn't have been happy if i'd have paid separately for breakfast however on this occasion it did come with the room.
Over-all I don't feel the hotel stay was worth what i paid - £242 for the night. I think you are probably paying for the location more than anything else! The room was a little disappointing even though it was supposedly an upgrade from a superior double to a executive room - i'm glad i didn't pay extra for this initially when booking. For the price paid i would have expected a much better standard and over-all experience. I would say this is more of a good 3/3.5 hotel than a 'luxury 4 star hotel' as the description says.",6.7,A little disappointing for £242 per night!,0,food/drink,0
