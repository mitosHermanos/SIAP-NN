I would like to commend the staff Kayla for so kindly changing my room to one that has stairs-free access.

Thanks to Kayla's thoughtfulness, I was spared the trouble and hassle as we had two big luggage. In addition, she made an extra effort to check if the room was ready. I was very glad I decided to approach her to check on our room for the second time. 
Her colleague , Mr Cheok, who had checked us in 10 minutes earlier , on the other hand simply told us that the room was not ready and we could leave luggage here and return at 3 pm. He did not take the initiative to do more than necessary. Neither did he advise that the room I had booked had to be accessed via some steps.

We then asked for extra blankets because we were freezing. He told us that he could only give us one as the cleaning staff were going to complain (like that was my problem). He was more concerned about us getting people inside the room than to solve the real problem. He told us that he already fixed the heat (which he didn't) but that we were not going to need the blankets. I told him that we were going to decide if it was warm enough for us, not him. We were freezing. Told him that he could stay outside to check if someone else got inside our room the whole night, which it was ridiculous but we just wanted to sleep and not get sick, which we ended up catching a cold.

Unfortunately, our room was not clean. There were sweets/candy clearly visible on the carpet, left by the previous occupant (which makes your wonder how clean the rest of the room was) and the bathroom smelt badly of what I will only describe as 'sewerage'.

The check in staff member wrote our room number so badly in our key folder that we went to the wrong room and had to go all the way back down to reception to get clarification for the room number. 
In the room the television didn't work properly and therr was no information about how to use the facilities.  I had to guess how to call housekeeping cause although there was a card next to the phone there was no number on it. 
The room was designed so there was only one major blinding overhead light - no lamps or reading lights - so when one of us wanted to sleep the other had to sit in complete darkness. 
Add to that even in the day we had to have the blinds drawn because the windows looked out on a filthy alley with several drunkards leering up at the windows so we were always gloomy or over lit.   
There was no attempt to soundproof the windows and we were kept up most of the night by the constant loudspeaker from Warren street station announcing it was closed or closing or evacuating..  Plus all the police and ambulance sirens.  
It was all small irritations but considering how expensive this hotel was it all added up to a very poor stay.

3421,Australia,Standard Double or Twin Room,3,September 2019,Couple," The room was terrible.  It was badly designed and very difficult to stay in.  The bathroom was not only badly designed but dangerous to use.  The bath was too high and almost impossible to get in and out of for a shower.  There were inexplicably several completely unnecessary steps along the corridor which were difficult to manoveur a suitcase over and no staff to help bring up bags or take you to your room. 
The check in staff member wrote our room number so badly in our key folder that we went to the wrong room and had to go all the way back down to reception to get clarification for the room number. 
In the room the television didn't work properly and therr was no information about how to use the facilities.  I had to guess how to call housekeeping cause although there was a card next to the phone there was no number on it. 
The room was designed so there was only one major blinding overhead light - no lamps or reading lights - so when one of us wanted to sleep the other had to sit in complete darkness. 
Add to that even in the day we had to have the blinds drawn because the windows looked out on a filthy alley with several drunkards leering up at the windows so we were always gloomy or over lit.

The staff on the evening shift at the lobster and steak restaurant did not understand their menu, their attention to us was remote and every time we had to ask for more water, to take the plates away and also to give us our bill.  It was my birthday meal, the staff were well aware of this and it did not meet the usual high standard of Radisson Blu to which we are accustomed.  Our last Blu was Prague on my wifes birthday and the staff their made her birthday one to remember.",5.4,Disappointed in our room and our evening meal..........not cheap but I feel sub standard for a Blu,0,food/drink,0

Rather bizarre hook on the floor which is very uncomfortable when you stand on it by mistake.  The virtual host app messaged whilst we were still trying to get some sleep in the morning. I know it’s in the centre of London but Very poor value for the cost. You should at least be able to sleep when you book a room.,5.0,Extremely disappointing.,0,price,0

3634,Germany,Superior Single Room,2,February 2019,Solo traveler," The hotel met many critria to be unpleasant for me as guest.
Normally, hotel interests dominated the interests of the guest.
Several 'never saw this before' situations.
A FEW aspects:
1. ROOM:
I paid more for the Radisson hotel room, assuming to get better / bigger room. This expectation met not the reality.
- The room was small and dirty, esp. bathroom and shower (see selected photos).
- Equipment was from the 90ies. Ventilation/heating system was loud.
Especially tele-dialog of the TV-set was time consuming and simply directed you to pay tv.
- Furniture: No space for using a chair at the desk. The furniture structure suggested to seat at the bed for using the desk.
Since desk and bed were located far from one to another, the desk was no place to stay longer...
2. COSTOMER SERVICE approach:
Generally, communication, structures and processes mostly focused on the interests of the hotel.
Most of the staff does the job and is not further interested in the guest. Aspects:
- Check in: unfriendly, incompetent 'machinary' first-contact communication (where was the ""welome"" which was meant?!)
- Requesting a feedback questionnaire on the quality, the reception was unable to find any or to present an alternative or relevant reaction (I did not want to waste more time in inconvenient discussion of a whole list of shortcomings, which most probably would lead to nothing...)
- Breakfast is served 7.30 (Why this late? Losing  time due to the time schedules of the hotel?). I came 7.20 and was not allowed to take seat (never experienced to be rejected this way). They really served nothing special (compare to other hotels), so that there is no argument for this very late opening of breakfast and rejecting early guests.

3635,Germany,Superior Single Room,2,February 2019,Solo traveler," The hotel met many critria to be unpleasant for me as guest.
Normally, hotel interests dominated the interests of the guest.
Several 'never saw this before' situations.
A FEW aspects:
1. ROOM:
I paid more for the Radisson hotel room, assuming to get better / bigger room. This expectation met not the reality.
- The room was small and dirty, esp. bathroom and shower (see selected photos).
- Equipment was from the 90ies. Ventilation/heating system was loud.
Especially tele-dialog of the TV-set was time consuming and simply directed you to pay tv.
- Furniture: No space for using a chair at the desk. The furniture structure suggested to seat at the bed for using the desk.
Since desk and bed were located far from one to another, the desk was no place to stay longer...
2. COSTOMER SERVICE approach:
Generally, communication, structures and processes mostly focused on the interests of the hotel.
Most of the staff does the job and is not further interested in the guest. Aspects:
- Check in: unfriendly, incompetent 'machinary' first-contact communication (where was the ""welome"" which was meant?!)
- Requesting a feedback questionnaire on the quality, the reception was unable to find any or to present an alternative or relevant reaction (I did not want to waste more time in inconvenient discussion of a whole list of shortcomings, which most probably would lead to nothing...)
- Breakfast is served 7.30 (Why this late? Losing  time due to the time schedules of the hotel?). I came 7.20 and was not allowed to take seat (never experienced to be rejected this way). They really served nothing special (compare to other hotels), so that there is no argument for this very late opening of breakfast and rejecting early guests.
