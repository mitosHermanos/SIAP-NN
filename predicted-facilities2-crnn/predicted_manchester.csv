The service at this hotel is excellent, reception person at 2 am was very polite and helpful and an extra bonus was being upgraded to a truly luxurious room with runway view that my husband really enjoyed in the morning.  Everything in this hotel is quality from staff to furnishings, the bed was sublime and the breakfast was of a very high standard and cooked lovingly, all staff very polite.  This hotel is truly amazing, shame we only stay for one night always after our holiday.  Many thanks for a positive experience following our holiday.

Don't bother! The breakfast was nothing to get excited about. Also, it was not explained beforehand that dinner would only be offered from a VERY limited menu (called the Bed and Breakfast option when I checked in). Only 4 options to pick from for main entree. It did offer Starter, Entree and desert. The started I chose was the Caesar salad, a real joke of 7-10 lettuce leaves with dressing. Since I stayed 2 nights, my choices were very limited. Don't expect to order from the regular menu! Ordered the bacon cheeseburger the first night. Hamburgers in the restaurant came in 3 sizes. My option was only the smallest on the menu. I DID pay for these meals, but I felt like the hotel/restaurant thought they were giving me my meals for free. Second night, had the Fish and Chips. Have you ever had lukewarm fried food? Well, that's what it was. The regular items being served at tables all around me looked very hot, tasty and worthy of a Radisson Restaurant.

5378,United Kingdom,Standard Room,1,February 2019,Couple," Both bed and breakfast were excellent. We arrived after trains had finished running. The flight was on time so we had booked a month or so earlier. My wife stays here when she goes to relatives in south west Ireland as well. This time we had had the full Manchester. Airport treatment, walked for miles in totally unnecessary queue lanes -  when we hit them with an EasyJet load there was nobody at the passport machines, but they didn’t let us in about half way down, maybe they enjoy watching people dragging or carrying their luggage up and down a dozen or two times, meeting people for the first time as they pass time and time again, eventually by the time they hit the passport machines.feeling like old friends. To tell the truth, on the way out we could have done with a night at the Radisson following the trauma of Manchester Airport’s uniquely uncivilised ‘security’ treatment. Maybe if they persuaded whoever trains the Radisson staff to retrain the security staff at the Airport itself that might help passengers to be treated like human beings instead of ignorant cattle. Our room key didn’t work, so a staff member shot up to the room with new keys and a smile and an apology. At breakfast the staff were welcoming, making it feel that everybody was glad to see us, and of course, whoever was behind the scenes preparing the breakfasts had a touch of genius.",10.0,A perfect end to solve the problems of a lousy evening.,1,staff,1

By the way when you are paying £9 for a cocktail the glass should be full.
  This is the second time we have eaten in the Restaurant. Breakfast is nice but this is the second time the food at dinner has been dreadful. The pate was horrible dense, bitter, with soggy toast, no chutney. We were not asked how we would like our main meals cooked which were completely over cooked when they arrived.  My burger was so dry and over cooked I couldn't eat it. I asked the unfriendly waiter for another as I couldn't swallow it without taking a drink.  The Manager who was unsmiling and unfriendly asked what was wrong and I explained it was burnt and over cooked and asked for another, medium. The second burger was worse it was even more over done, when you cut it in half and squeezed there was no moisture. The Manager apologized and asked if I wanted another. I declined as any even I can cook burgers better than that. We had hoped the food had improved since our last visit but it hasn't.",8.3,Disapointing,0,staff,0

The dinner we had on the whole was not good. It was from the set menu. First course  chicken wings with dip very good and served nice and hot. I said if the next courses  be s nice meal But sadly  that was not the case I chose  the burger. Well presented but it wss over done and very dry  it was like eating cardboard. The bun was done to s crisp and not easy to get a knife through As for the rasher of bacon that was hard extremely  over cooked,It could of been done at Breakfast  and wss left over The chips was nice but as for the burger I could of got a better burger in Burger  King. I told the waiter and showed s bit of burger to him and showed how it broke up in prices as I touched  it. All he could say or our burgers are well done. I said  that's fine but they should have moisture  within them this is like eating  cardboard
The desert  I asked if was a backed cheesecake  he replied  it's not hot.
We both had that it arrived nice presentation  with raspberries  and a sauce  drizzled  over no ice cream or cream.It wss differently not baked.it was a biscuit  base√ filled with a mouse  type filling but it was not light it was firm, rubbery with far to much geletine. When eating it was cladding  inside your mouth.
I saw the matra De  (Supervisor )later she seemed to take it all in !! And went in some way of putting it right with a couple of glasses wine.
Also found out that they did not deliver your newspaper to your door outside but you had to get it from reception and the weighing scales  it's a 1.00pound. It's less money 20p for putting air in your tyres 
These  things I would not have expected  paying over 200 pounds and a 4 star hotel.
But from that it's very convenient  for terminal  2.

There was a buffet available with individual portions of cereals, fruits, muffins, ham, etc., but we decided to select the hot option. I chose the full English breakfast and toast, while my girlfriend chose the breakfast panini. After about 10 minutes the waitress returned to apologise and say that they had no paninis left and so took an order of sausage and scrambled egg as a substitute. 5 minutes later she returned with a panini and said the chef had managed to find one. She then reconfirmed my order 15 minutes after taking it and I had to wait another 5-10 minutes before it was served. The overall impression was of a kitchen that was badly disorganised.
Both options were not particularly good quality. The panini wasn’t toasted very well and didn’t appear to have any egg mayonnaise. The full English was all there, but none of it tasted particularly good. The coffee was also not particularly good.

12415,United Kingdom,Standard Room,1,December 2019,Group," Food choices in the main restaurant were awful. Food quality was poor and the staff unable to offer much in the way of dietary choices. All I was given was a sheet with tick boxes telling me what allergens were in a dish, but no detail. I am Lactose intolerant, but also cannot eat beef (as 25% of people with dairy issues often are.) Most of the non dairy items were beef related. So my choices on the menu came down to one item. Nothing was available for dessert as it ALL contains dairy. I would have been better ordering from the bar as there is a Vegan Pizza on offer there, but that wasn't offered in the main restaurant.

Check-in at reception Level 9. Waiting time not acceptable. Just one guest in front, but receptionist was not bothered to speed up the process. Was talking about this and that endless. The approach was not business oriented. May some customer feel pampered and as a VIP having a chat, but I prefer to have an efficient check in. Check out was the same, one guest in front and waiting time. I had to ask if I can check out also at main reception. Another guest was in the lift and said that he is not happy about the odd approach. At the main reception I was not even ask if I enjoyed my stay. Only that all is set.
Had ask at the evening if I can get a Coffee to go in the Executive lounge early morning and when I have been there at 6:30am were no Cups to go available. The staff at Exc. reception was arguing that its not usual and they only have coffee in the lounge. Sorry but this is a simple task and I had ask before.
