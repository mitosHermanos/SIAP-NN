127,United Kingdom,Superior Room with River view,1  ,August 2020,Couple," We stayed at the Radisson Blu last night, being post lockdown we were still required to use masks in the breakfast room this morning which the hotel supplied along with hand sanitiser 
There were also stations with masks and sanitiser in the reception area 
Social distancing prompts throughout the hotel were being followed by staff and guests alike 
Beautiful breakfast was excellent value for money 
The property was very clean and comfortable very welcoming after traveling in to the city 
Only downside was the AC wasn’t very cool so rather hot and uncomfortable overnight 
Trouser press didn’t work which really wasn’t a problem and the bar that held the shower head came off as I tried to adjust it, meaning we could use the shower this morning but there was a lovely deep/wide bath so also not a big problem

It was very pale so there was obviously too much milk in it and it was sticky and heavy. It was served everyday except one, and surely the amount of scrambled egg being left uneaten on plates tells you something?? I asked for a fried egg, and that was OK, but if there was any chance of a cooked to order omlette, I didn't see the sign. There wasn't much fresh fruit, and it was mostly the same. Finally, I know coffee machines are a labour-saving device, but for the cost of the breakfast and the star rating of the hotel, It was not OK to be using a coffee machine, similar to one I saw the other day in Kwik-Fit!!

Asked to check in early as had two babies with me I was advised could check in early and to ask for the lady (Deena) when I arrived. So I arrived with a suitcase, crib, bag with bottle preps and tow babies in two to be told I could no longer check in early. And if I wanted to they could downgrade me which would cost more money but smaller bed which was a no as we had a bigger bed for a reason with 4 of us in a room.!!! Went back 4/5 times to ask about check in and was told to come back in 10/15 minutes each time! This was very stressful as they was fully aware the wedding was starting at 12 in their hotel and I had all my luggage with me plus the two babies! . Eventually the wedding started and we only got to check in exactly at the check in time! Was very unhelpful! 
The room once got in it was old and worn and smelt like it had been cleaned by a damp cloth all over!!

This was our first weekend away from our special needs adopted daughter in 6 years & we had wanted it to be a room we could relax & recharge in but it was upsetting instead.

You had to wait on cutlery and cups, at one stage we were told to use paper cups as they had no clean one.  On Sunday there was no bread and the chef came out to say if you can wait 9 minutes I could get some????? Hello you’re a hotel.  Ditch your scrambled eggs, disgusting.  Have the staff not told you how many plates go back with it on it because it is so bad.  Still waiting on Dean or someone (I think her name was Dina) to get back to us over a week later.

2758,United Kingdom,Superior Room with River view,1  ,November 2019,Couple," Upon arrival of the property, there was a strange odour within the lobby area that myself and partner both noticed and said. We stayed on the fifth floor and there was also a strong smell of paint right a long the corridor, the paint smell can’t be helped obviously and there was plenty of signs to indicate what was still wet etc, but the smell in the lobby wasn’t the best start - wasn’t unbearable but wasn’t pleasant either. Our room was okay, it seemed quite dated and was clean enough. One of our bathroom lights was broke and flicked constantly when switched on, the tube needs replaced (room 508 - floor 5). Our bed was very low to the ground, and slanted. It felt as though I was a lot higher up than my partner, but I think this reason was because it was two king beds that had been pushed together to create the double. The pillows, and quilts were both comfortable and warm though. In the morning after what was an okay sleep we went to make a coffee each, when we had a look at the tea and coffee condiments there was a handful of different teas, plenty of sugar and sweetener but only one sachet of coffee, I don’t know if this was a mistake or the normality but was a problem for us as we both enjoy a coffee in the morning, what made it worse was that we had also ordered two with our breakfasts in the morning to the room, and it turned up without any coffee, and instead just orange juice which we didn’t order. Check out was fine and again pleasant, and we are certain that if we raised the issue with a member of staff they would have been kind enough to sort our demands. It wasn’t the best stay but can’t fault the staff, I just think I have for sure stayed in better Radisson’s elsewhere in different cities than this one and they have perhaps set a higher standard than this particular establishment.",7.9,Good Facilities and Friendly Staff.,1,0,location|noisiness|dirty|bathroom|bed|comfort|drink|food|staff|,1

I made this booking from Melbourne, Australia and this was a Christmas gift for my parents who live in Liverpool, England.  I noted that it would not be me who would be checking in, and gave the booking contact name and details.  When my parents attempted to check in, there were told that they had to pay for the room as they didn't have my credit card.  They were hit with a $311.61 (1 hundred and 72 pound) bill!!  My parents called me immediately and I spoke with Dinah on reception who was rude and unhelpful and passed the blame to Booking.com for not providing the hotel payment policy correct information.  I was told to call back on Monday (the booking was for a Saturday) and that I would need to speak with the hotel accounts team.  Since my booking was non refundable, even if my parents refused to stay, I would have still been charged!!  My Mum paid the $311.61 on her credit card and they continued with their planned hotel stay.  They had a really nice time, but the whole trip was tainted by the first encounter and the worry that they had to foot a very expensive hotel stay, when they only lived 40 minutes out of the city!  I called the accounts team as advised by Dinah on Monday and spoke to a really helpful lady called Natalia who apologized for the incident, processed a refund on Mums card and confirmed that the payment would be taken from my card, as originally planned.  The whole incident was very stressful and took the excitement, fun, and Christmas cheer away from the fact that this was supposed to be a Christmas present - it cut into my parents spending money and they spent the rest of the day/night being very careful with what they spent just incase the refund request was declined on the Monday when I was advised to call.",7.5,"Lovely hotel, great location, rude and unsympathetic reception staff!",1,0,price|staff|location|,1

The approach of the person was all wrong. A simple apology and offer to take £5 off the parking bill would have sufficed, rather than saying ""the max discount I can offer is £5"". This is especially because I only said ""it would be nice to apologise for the inconvenience or at least offer something for the inconvenience.

3391,United Kingdom,Superior Room with River view,3  ,October 2018,Couple," The room information was erroneous in that it said there was a fridge, but the policy has changed and all the fridges have been decommissioned. The front desk staff are happy to put things in a small fridge but you have to keep going up and down for that. There is a small ice bucket in the room with ice stations on each landing. Not anything like as good as having a fridge in the room though (we'd had plans for keeping some picnic-type stuff in the fridge and had to abandon that idea.)  The TVs were not working properly while we were there and this was a total hotel problem (except for the bar area) and the technicians were having trouble putting it right. We feel it was too expensive for what was on offer, although that is just a personal view. (Having said that, it you make good use of the pool and gym you are recouping a bit of the expense!) The restaurant was probably a bit on the dear side (but then so are a lot of eating places around the centre - we checked some of them out in passing). Finally, some might find it a little further away from the centre and main part of the waterfront than desired (incl. the river cruise start point opposite the Liver Building which is 12 mins' walk away, also the hop-on hop-off bus start points, and the Museum of Liverpool. The National Trust minibus tour of the Beatles Houses starts from Jury's Inn which is 25 mins' brisk walk away near Albert Dock, and the John Lewis area of shops would be about 20 mins. The cathedrals would probably be about 25 - 30 minutes' walk - bit less coming back as you are going downhill!)  - so check out the position to be sure, before booking. As it happened we didn't mind at all once we'd got our bearings, and we walked miles all over Liverpool (felt like it anyway!) and it was quite convenient to get back to.

Unfortunately the bathroom (toilet area and the shower) is designed for people with disabilities. There are people without any issues but there are people (like me) with different phobias and for me isn’t cool at all to use the bathroom and  being kind of scared of this facilities- very uncomfortable... there’s a must to be described all this facilities at the stage when you’re booking your stay - as when I booked the room wasn’t specified anything about that and definitely  wouldn’t be what I could ask for.
I’m pointing all this not expecting to be recompensed for this “unexcited experience”, I just believe all this missed details can be fixed and leave an amazing impact on your customers otherwise your staff (at the reception and in the morning at the restaurant at the breakfast  - I interacted only with them) were very friendly and helpful and is sad to see your staff hard work and delivering good customer service and to loose customers for such important details that somehow been neglected.

The receptionist was pretty snotty with me when I asked for a couple of minutes to double check my emails to ensure that I hadn't booked breakfast, and didn't end up paying again.  She was just desperate to charge us an extortionate amount rather than wait for me to check.  In hindsight I wish I hadn't have purchased breakfast anyway as it wasn't great.  Undercooked bacon, overcooked tomatoes and hash browns.... empty fruit selections.  I should have saved my money and found another establishment to have breakfast.  Location was further out of the city centre than I had hoped, and it was a nightmare to get to and from.  View of docks from our room (specifically booked a river view)  blocked by building works over the road.  Bathroom needed some attention...wasn't spotless as I'd assume, and once housekeeping had been done on our second day, only half of the tiles had been replenished.

The air conditioning was poor and very noisy.  The facilities in the room were very basic, the mini-bar/fridge had been removed and there was no complementary water.  There were no additional pillows and when we requested some from reception they failed to turn up.  The hotel is based in a largely business area that is being heavily renovated so there are few restaurants, bars or other facilities nearby.  The road outside the hotel was closed due to construction and the nearest car-park was supposed to be 5 mins walk away but was more like 10.  The breakfast was a very basic buffet which was all self-service including coffee and toast so was more like a Service Station than a Radisson Blu.  The restaurant seating was a very odd design with tables of two sat almost next to each other.  The two coffee machines produced individual cups at a very, very slow rate, individually grinding each cup.  Jugs of coffee served by waiting staff would be far more efficient and a much better service to customers.  There were only scrambled eggs on the buffet and no additional options presented, the hash browns were anaemic and it was like a treasure hunt to find small plates for the cold food.

However, the reception staff kept advising that it MIGHT be available earlier, so we kept hanging at the hotel, being a tad travel weary.  It would have been better to have been told that the room was definitely not available until 3pm - and not raise our expectations.  Staff at reception were unfriendly and not usefully informative.   The experience did not get better from there.  The restaurant is easily the worst one we have experienced in our travels to date (4 weeks) around Europe and UK.  Rubbery and tasteless  food on the hot plates eg: scrambled eggs sitting in their own whey three breakfasts running; the best items being the sausages, bacon and tomatoes, which were at best, tepid; coffee not pleasant, sticky tables, One evening meal not available at 8.30pm on a Saturday as had run out of food - only Room Service available (?);  Fridges in room ""being decommissioned"", so no cold water;  all the glassware etc available ..   Here is the list we gave to Reception and left in the room as well :  Poor toilet flushing;  airconditioning unit very loud.  9 floors up, so if you turn it off, the room is too stuffy to sleep;  chair at table very unstable, looked as if it might implode when someone sat on it;  shower support loose- did not hold shower head upright or firmly;  shower door seal leaks creating a very wet floor - could slip.

The TV seems only to have 5 analogue channels and the controller is intermittent.
There are no biscuits and the mini bar has nothing in it (staff advised all room fridges had been decommissioned)
The drawers have no sides so clothing falls out. 
We have already had to make a trip to reception because both the room cards stopped working. My wife got stranded in the fitness centre vestibule because the key card did not work.
We were told free lockers were available in the fitness centre, however when we got there we were told a £1 coin is needed to rent padlocks (the attendant did lend us 2 free when we told him we had no change).
The male toilet light was faulty.
The spa area is quite shabby with various damage and areas of bare plaster, we did not feel the area was very hygienic. The changing rooms are poorly furnished with no costume dryers, unspecified product, no obvious moisturiser or conditioner.

4368,United Kingdom,Premium Room with River View,2  ,March 2019,Couple," So first impressions of this hotel were very good, the location of the hotel is pretty good too, I requested a room with a view of the river outside and the hotel provided this.
The main lobby is very modern and clean with access into the restaurant and bar area, the check in area was a little busy but only took a few minutes to clear.
This is where we get to the bad bit... The room, from the description on the website was meant to be a really nice room.. I was visiting for birthday celebrations so naturally chose what I thought would be a nice hotel. Upon entering the room, we noted how dated the room was looking and that it was not modern to the same standard as the main lobby area.
The bed was actually quite comfortable and we had a sitting chair and a table chair along with pen, paper and a phone. The website advertised a free bottle of water in your room, this was not provided. We also wasn't informed that the mini bars in the room had been deactivated so there was no supplied stock and no where to store any chilled items we may have brought with us. The TV was a bit of a let down, it had just over 10 standard definition aerial channels, if you were lying on your bed and was trying to watch one of the channels, you would struggle due to the poor picture quality. By the windows (last couple of pictures) we have clear evidence of mold and this was one of the biggest let downs of a radisson blu hotel, I expected this to be a non-existent problem in a 4 star hotel.. How this hotel is still 4 star baffles me.
The bathroom was quite modern with a nice sink, but again we had issues with mold being around the bath and shower area. On our first night we noticed that the adjustable shower head was broken so we couldn't change the setting and the temperature was either artic or desert (freezing cold, boiling hot), there was no Inbetween.
Probably the nicest part was the downstairs spa and fitness area.",5.8,Not worth 4 Stars.,1,0,location|comfort|dirty|restaurant|drink|bed|bathroom|price|tv|wifi|temperature|fitness|,1

We asked nicely and were told that the hotel was too full for more than one pillow each (4 star hotel ?!?!) and that we simply could not have robes.

The pastries and rolls at breakfast were stale and had obviously been carried over from Saturday.

down to the dinning room. My wife asked for the manager who then blamed
reception and it wasn’t their fault, do you not operate a team hotel?

The room was terrible it said we would have a river view hence the higher price, when really we had a steamed up window which over looked a building site. We was on the 5th floor and seen not even half the river due to cranes etc so we felt ripped off as we was in a less than standard room!! We then come to check out on Sunday and the lifts were broke so after waiting 15 minutes for a lift that never come we tried to find stairs down, well what a surprise we found stairs which took us to the basement and there was no way out, we had to walk half way back up and then walk to the lifts on another floor to get down. £224 is a small holiday for someone, we decided to splash out an go for the room that would make it special and it was abysmal, well over priced and I will never stay here again, not even so much as a complimentary bottle of water for £224.",4.6,Disappointing,1,0,price|drink|restaurant|location|dirty|bathroom|,0

The room service tray left outside our neighbours door with remains of breakfast which was left there for 24 hours. The hotel was filthy and run down. I paid the price of a 5 star hotel and the experience was akin to something out of Faulty Towers. The two bar staff ladies who were rude, aggressive and didnt bother to serve anyone food or drinks as they were complaining about how overworked they were. A spilled drink remained on the bar / cafe floor for a good hour before anyone cleaned it up. The bar was not busy as it was early afternoon, so there was no excuse for the lack of service and the rudeness.The fact that the Reception staff seemed to be familiar with these two girls and their attitude and apologised to residents on their behalf as if they were well used to them. The man at the pool reception who said he could not give me slippers as they were running low. When I told him our room had only been stocked with one pair he made me leave the swimming pool reception and go and find housekeeping to get a pair.

Bedroom was tired and dated, despite the fact that I had been upgraded to a Business class room.  No frills at all such as cushions, throws, pillow choices or nice decor which was disappointing as I paid a LOT of money for what was supposed to be a luxury weekend there.  Prices were high (more than double the normal rate) as it was a busy weekend in Liverpool but the hotel did not pay for any extra staff to deal with full capacity.  TV reception in bedroom was very poor and was never able to get BBC1 at all, mini fridge didn't work, wardrobe handles were loose. Breakfast was chaos - not enough staff, no cutlery, tables and serving areas a mess and ran out of several items of food and condiments. Spent the whole weekend gutted at the amount of money I paid to stay there. At the time of booking I had the choice of many cheaper hotels but chose this one for what I thought would be luxury. BIG mistake. I complained to the hotel at the time but they said they couldn't help as I'd booked through Booking.com. I complained to Booking.com, they e mailed the hotel but the hotel didn't bother to reply!  I will NEVER stay in a Radisson Blu hotel again. Utter disgrace.",4.6,"What a disappointment!
