We were suggested to pay extra and stay in 2 bedroom apartment instead. I did say that we have payed already for one bedroom apartment so it should be one available at least without view (must admit we have booked this hotel based on conversation over the phone that this type of appartment is available for our stay). We have been offered to switch the apartment next day if this guest will leave. We have done this, but the room had no balcony as the one that we stayed the night before, so I believe receptionist had herself confused as to which appartments have balconies and which not.

2030,Australia,One Bedroom Apartment,4  ,June 2019,Couple," Where do we start? The staff are reminiscent of Manuel from Fawlty Towers - although his command of English and perception of guest needs were superior. The fact that it is virtually impossible to find a staff-member whose first language is English means that much is lost in the translation (either deliberately or otherwise). Our one-bedroom apartment (almost 350 pounds a night) could have been good if re-furbished, but it was in an appalling state of disrepair, with cupboard doors and drawers chipped and mal-aligned, a non-working dishwasher, large gouges out of the wooden floor (and parts of it that had lifted off completely), doors that didn't shut properly, a pungent and sickening influx of onion and garlic cooking smells several times a day, tatty furniture, no table to eat at, missing and mis-matched cutlery - the list goes on! The advertised coffee pods were not replaced each day (until we asked), and our bathrobes were removed during cleaning on the second day and had to be retrieved. The housekeeping was perfunctory and erratic. An extra 12.5% was added to our room service bill (not mentioned in the menu) and the quality of the food was mediocre. We took friends to the hotel's breakfast on one morning, and it was embarrassing - tired quintessential English greasy (and cold) hot dishes (one slice or two of congealed scrambled eggs? - with slightly exotic dishes such as eggs benedict or espresso coffee an extra cost). We reported the non-working dishwasher and onion smells to housekeeping and were assured that ""maintenance"" would look at it, but nothing happened.

'Wait over there - we're busy with somethin' was the abrupt order. Not what I was expecting after flying back from Sydney.

When I went to reception the staff member couldn't work out why I'd come to see them. I then asked for a 2nd room key as the one I had kept faulting and I didn't want to take the lift 9 floors to reception each time my door wouldn't open. The guy on the desk looked completely confused. Why is that so odd? The apartment needs redecorating - it looks tired and the air-con doesn't work in the lounge so it was very hot.

I spoke to reception about my disappointment, and was told that the room size was correct, and when I asked for an alternate I was told that there were no other rooms available, but she would get maintenance and housekeeping to address my concerns.
After then coming back from an evening out to find  none of the above issues to be resolved and no explanation or apology given I was left annoyed.
After coming back to the hotel the next evening to still be in the same situation, my patients finally broke and brought the manager up to the room to show him my concerns.
I was told that the room size was to their executive standard, but he was concerned that the other issues had not been addressed.

1: A change of room which I declined

2089,Croatia,Superior Double Room,3  ,November 2018,Group," My friend booked the room from 16.-19. November. The first night was paid in advance, so we only had to pay for 2 nights.

He asked for a credit card for pre-authorization and we wanted to give the one we already paid the first night with, but he didn't want to take it. He insisted on another one instead. I gave him mine and asked what will he do with it and he said he won't take any money from it, it is only the guarantee we will pay for our stay. Next, I checked my bank account and it showed that the hotel took amount of money for 2 nights (including the deposit). I complained to another receptionist and she said the money isn't taken but ""frozen"".  Next thing, my friend's father informed her that the hotel called him on his phone and asked if he wants to pay for the rest 2 nights with that same card (the one we used for first night and the one they didn't want to take for pre-authorization) and he refused, because he knew they already have frozen our money. On Sunday we went to inform the reception about this behaviour and that we are shocked that you have guests in your hotel willing to pay, and you refuse it and then call someone who isn't there at all to pay. We explained everything all over again to another receptionist, and she apologized and asked if we want to pay now and I agreed. They said they will make the payment from frozen amount of money, but they took ANOTHER amount of money from my card which means I paid DOUBLE. I complained again to the chief desk officer and she said she will talk to accountant first thing on Monday to release the money and it will be in 3-5 working days back.

Few issues with room (wont go into them as they are not the reason for the poor review) which where minor. The real issue was, despite reporting the issues 3 times, they where not dealt with.
This appeared to me to be a staff problem more than an hotel problem.
The follow up resolution was excellent and what we would have expected.
I have taken a couple of weeks to reflect as sometimes spontaneous reviews are never a true reflection of a stay and it is important to point out the positives, breakfast as usual excellent, reception staff very good and follow up to problems was excellent.

2129,Australia,One Bedroom Apartment,4  ,August 2018,Couple," We would stay here again because of the location, but the hotel could be even better if only there were more attention to some details. We stayed in a spacious one bedroom suite, with self-catering facilities. However, the carpets were filthy and torn/threadbare, the wooden floor in the lounge area was heavily damaged, the dishwasher didn't work (and wasn't fixed in the four days we stayed after reporting this) some light globes needed replacing, the furniture was very knocked about and internal doors were heavy to open and shut. The blind for the bathroom window was broken and the washbasin sprayed water in all directions (again, not attended to even though we had asked for it to be fixed). We needed to ask for sugar sachets (twice). Staff were friendly, but for most English was clearly their second language, and we suspect that some things just got lost in translation. What could have been an exceptional hotel (it has all the basics) was a little Fawlty Tower-ish in some aspects. The good outweighed the bad and we were in relaxed holiday mode, so we just laughed off these things, but it was sad that things could obviously have been much better with comparatively little needed to achieve that.",7.1,"Great location and fundamentally good, but some shortcomings",1,0,location|bathroom|dirty|staff|,1

2132,Trinidad and Tobago,Superior Double Room,4  ,August 2018,Family," Data- August 24-28th 2018 family books two rooms at London Victoria Park Plaza.
Problems;
1) Hotel under construction/refurbishment but this is not relayed on website.
2) Unpleasant smell on entering hotel, checkin-reception area and lobby. Most similar to urine.
3) Requested adjoining rooms- unavailable.
4)Rotten sandwich in minibar, with foul smell.
5)Moved to another room, which was "" ....ready."" with nonfunctioning minibar, no kettle, missing pillows.
6) Moved to ""executive room"". Same size as other rooms if not smaller, but executive because of coffee machine robe and slippers. Rusty faucet.
7) Do not disturb indicator on door, but room was entered and items were missing.
8) Cost to stay at hotel is misleading and implies high standards and quality.
9) After seeing four rooms at the establishment, the conclusion is:
There is no standard of room set-up,  cleanliness is lacking. Implying that proper inspection is not taking place.
Housekeeping Staff and room service work in disconnect and see no reason to excel at their job, because of lack of incentive.
The staff at reception are disgruntled, and give the impression that guests are a bother.

2139,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,5  ,August 2018,Family," We have stayed here a number of times in the last 3/4 years. We
always have two rooms sometimes up to four rooms at a time. It’s very
central and convenient for everything. However last time we stayed
earlier this year we felt things in the hotel were looking a little
shabby and tired, we noticed a difference of amenities in each of the
rooms even though two were supposed to be the same. This time we have
had four rooms three the same and one different type, again totally
different amenities, simple things like slippers in some but not all, no
ironing board in one but it had an iron, no face clothes in any
something there has always been in the past. Lack of loo roll, lack of
clean towels. We were asked when we checked in how many days we would
not like housekeeping, as we were there for five nights we agreed only
one, we were given a voucher worth £10 per room for money off our lounge
bar bill in exchange for no housekeeping. We in fact only had our rooms
cleaned twice and that was after we called reception to report there had
been no housekeeping done! As for the voucher you would think that would
be straight forward but no we only ended up have £2 removed from our bar
bill, (this was rectified at reception when we checked out!) I
appreciate Work needs to be carried out at some point but out of the
five days only once did all four lifts work usually only two, surly
August is a busy month to be doing such work and the reception desk was
blocked off with a small temporary one being used. We felt things on the

2143,Germany,Superior Double Room,4  ,August 2018,Family," There were a lot of minor flaws, which summed up to an overall disappointment. The rooms were said to be ready by 2.00 Pm, we arrived at 3:30 and the larger room was still not done. It took more than an additional hour before we were let into the room. The large room (I think it was called junior suite) was an annex on the roof and had two sides of windows and a flat roof. That caused the room to heat up quickly, during the hot days in this year's August the air conditioning could not cope with that. The cleaning staff opened the blinds every day so that the room heated up all day.
The bathroom needs renovation, the mirrors show large areas of rust. The shower cabin was severely leaking so the bathroom was flooded after each shower. 
There were no spots to hang the towels. There was no power outlet near a mirror, so using a blow dryer was kind of impossible. 
When opening the room door, the light in the bathroom was lit. It could only be switched off from a panel next to the bed - that means there was no way to discretely leave the room when one person woke up earlier, without waking the others up.
None of these flaws were major, but all in all our stay did not match the aspiration level of a park plaza hotel - nor did it match the paid price.",7.1,"Excellent location, but does not live up to the aspiration level",1,0,temperature|dirty|staff|bathroom|tv|location|bed|price|,1

2149,United States of America,Superior Double Room,6  ,August 2018,Solo traveler," The location was the only good thing about this hotel. But here are some bad things that I have experienced during my stay at this hotel. First night: I was in a room on the third floor. The room and furniture were literally shaking and about to collapse whenever the door in the next room was opened and closed, like an earthquake. I asked them to change it and they did, and believe or not, they said it’s so common in their hotel to hear from residents about the doors problem. Second issue: After three nights, I decided to extend my stay due to a flight change, so the hotel pre-charged my credit card 5 times during my stay!! (Before the check out time!) totally charged me for more than a double of the whole total amount of the stay. When I complained and met the duty manager, he said there is an error in the system !! And to be honest he didn’t say the truth cuz these transactions are done manually. I asked them to hold the whole amount for the stay just once, and release the rest of holding money that they hold without any reason or right! He said apologized about what happened and said okay but he didn’t know when these amount supposed to get back to my card, therefore, I was so limited financially on my card until the time of writing this comments. Third issue, with the bed: the cover sheet and pillows’ sheets smell bad, they smell like a forgotten wet towel on the couch for days without getting it dried. I asked them to change them all, the did in the next day!! Third issue: they don’t put a new bag and form for the laundry again in the closet it you already used them. So you have to call every time to ask them to bring a bad & form to put in the closet in order to use them next time.
