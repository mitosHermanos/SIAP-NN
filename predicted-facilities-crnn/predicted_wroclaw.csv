266,Sweden,Double Room,1  ,July 2020,Couple, This hotel boasts with 4 **** Stars..... Nothing cools be more untrue !  Theselius stars were provanalys ratens in the 1990-ies . Lobby and restaurant looked nice and modern and the hotel is located next to the river.  Our room was duett! Spiderweb Haninge from the bedlamps. The minibar was broken and it was full of water and mould. Horrible Actually! All furniture were dates and worn out. The beds passet their prime decades ago. The toiletseat was loose and there were cracks in the mirror. We checken out one day earlier than planned .  This hotel did certainly not live up to the four star rating !,1.0,Never again,1,0,restaurant|comfort|location|dirty|bathroom|bed|,1
