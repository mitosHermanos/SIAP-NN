It felt safe and clean. Well managed safety procedures and protocols. Great to see a company thinking things through and implementing what seems to be the best measures in regard to covid-19.
Fantastic breakfast delivered to the room (Those sausages.... wow).  Incredibly prompt and good value room service for evening food and drink in the room.
It pleases me to say; probably the most courteous and aware hotel staff I've encountered. And surely 'double points' for being understandably stretched/maybe under staffed due to the current ever present covid situation.

1212,United Kingdom,Studio King (Family),3  ,August 2020,Family," We stayed here for three nights during August and had a terrific stay. The hotel is situated in a perfect central location and easily accessible. Our check in was swift and easy. The room was clean and we were able to request anything we needed throughout our stay. We also ordered room service which was also very good. 
The breakfast was excellent, the hotel has created a system to ensure that you can still enjoy a full buffet breakfast. This did involve them plating it up for you and a few minutes of queuing, but that wasn’t an issue at all. However the only issue we had was that some other guests still seem confused as to why the staff would have to serve it this way, why there are screens in place and didn’t seem to grasp why you would need all of these precautions. Top marks to the staff for dealing with some pretty idiotic questions during the service! 
Also wanted to highlight how superb the security and concierge staff were at this hotel. We were driving with our baby son and we had a lot of bags with us, which they helped us with considerably. There is also limited parking outside of the hotel and the staff ensured we had a spot and generally made our arrival and departure incredibly easy.

The room was lovely, my children loved the cookies and strawberries set up in the room.  Having a small kitchen area is ideal, so we could keep drinks in the fridge.  Also having two separate sleeping areas works really well for us.  My only complaint is our shower leaked despite the door being closed.
Breakfast was included so one morning we had in our room, couldn't fault the service.  The next morning we went downstairs, the selection available is excellent.  
The concierge service is brilliant, we were able to leave our luggage the morning we checked out so we didn't have to carry it around with us.
The facilties and management in place regarding covid was excellent.  Automatic temperature checks as you walk in.  Seperate entrance and exits.  Well spaced tables at breakfast.  Masks worn in public areas and plenty of hand sanitisers everywhere.

I would go again but I would say to bring your own stuff and not have anything out the room, it may also be better when the facilities are available but they handled the social distancing really well due to it being extremely packed. The staff was still calm and approachable. Maybe suggest having less booking during this time as it was nearly impossible to social distance when everyone was checking in and out at the same time.

1519,United Kingdom,Studio King (Family),3  ,August 2020,Family," This is a lovely hotel near to the Houses of Parliament and the South Bank. 
Was only intending to stay for 3 nights but extended it to 4 as the kids didn’t want to go home as we found loads nearby for them to do. 
The room was lovely, kids (5&3) stayed in the Living room on the sofa bed which they loved as they also had their own TV, The bed in the Bedroom was really comfortable. We made 3 requests, a few more pillows, arrived in 10mins. More loo roll same again and for the room to be clean which it was by the time we got back, so could’t fault anything really. (Room cleaning currently reduced due to COVID-19, but they will clean it on request) 
We were also lucky enough to see Shrek visiting the hotel which made the kids day as they then thought he was staying at the hotel too (Which of course he was..)Highly recommend the Shrek Adventure if staying with little ones, it’s a little bit pricey but worth the money. If your looking for things to do for Free, the Princess Diana Memorial Playground at Kensington Palace is well worth a visit. As is Archbishop's Park which is a few minutes walk from the hotel

I can't fault this place, really feel relaxed, cared for and refreshed from an hotel that should be really proud of its staff from management to the great doormen.  Also, and may sound funny, but i felt safe there with the kids, there were loads of staff & the whole atmosphere felt good.

2853,United States of America,Superior Double Room,3  ,July 2019,Solo traveler," Firstly, I was very tired after a long journey from California that also includes delays and sleeplessness so when I arrived, I really just wanted to check-in and get some sleep. I arrived approximately two hours before standard arrival time to be able to get a room, maybe even a little bit sooner than that. The staff member who processed my check-in was very accommodating and fortunately, they had rooms clean and were able to allow me to check in. This speaks highly of the cleaning staff who were very efficient and for the guests who left on time for this to occur. 
They were very friendly, courteous and gave fantastic instructions on how to get to my room as I was so tired. 
The room was so much more beyond what I expected from the online photos. It was inviting, clean, modern and stylish in every way. I was so happy to have air conditioning in the immense heatwave that London was experiencing and a very comfy bed. 
I eventually ordered room service and not only were they very expeditious in bringing the food but it was hot and quite tasty. 
I thought the location was very central to everything and although I did not eat in the restaurants onsite, they were very nice looking and the food smelled wonderful.

3024,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room - Disability Access,1  ,June 2019,Couple," I walk with a cane and their accessible rooms are great.

The room they gave us had a walk in shower but was (in my opinion) not ideal for a wheelchair due to lack of room on the side of the bed with the orange pull cord. But! It was perfect for me. I would always choose this hotel when staying in London. 
With regard to the staff - I had a nightmare of a journey to the hotel which caused me a lot of pain by the time I got there. The lady on reception asked me if I needed a wheelchair or any other assistance with bags to make it easier to get to my room.

All the staff was friendly and kind. The live music at the Primo Bar was amazing and the non alcoholic cocktail I ordered was really nice. (It was the fruity one, not sure of the name.) Everything from the room to the changing rooms was so clean. The swimming pool was nice and warm but I would definitely recommend bringing googles because it was heavily full of chlorine which effected my own personal experience. I really loved the idea of towels where you could take one, use it, ""bin it"" and grab another one if you needed. This was really handy.

There is a car park round the corner that costs £15 pounds for 24 hours! 
The staff was very helpful and kind but the main thing that stood out for me was the room, I loved my room, I had a view of London eye and inside the room we had a little lounge area where you could sit and enjoy a few drinks and listen to music on the tv. As you walked a little further in you had your bedroom where again you have another tv in there which offers chrome cast, it allowed me to play Netflix on the background and I loved it. 
You have a iron and iron board, you have a microwave and mini fridge, plates and glasses and even cutlery! I mean I have never been to a hotel which made me feel so much like home! 
I loved the bed it was a good size and really comfortable! 
Honestly one of if not the best 4 star hotel I’ve stayed in, I absolutely recommend it to anyone, I’ll for sure be staying here when I go London again!

We got the room which was so nice and the view was fantastic! Could see the London eye which was lit up lovely a night. 
The bed was super comfortable, the room was clean. 
Once we had settled and got our bags sorted we were welcomed by one of the staff to the hotel with a celebratory card and a bottle of champagne on ice. 
We were heading out for the evening where we came across a lobby worker in the elevator. He welcomed us again to the hotel, asked about our stay and what our plans were. He was super helpful telling us how to get there, he informed us that it was raining and supplied us with an umbrella. 
We ordered food to our room at 2am in the morning and I couldn’t describe how nice this really was. Very very happy with it. (Chargrill chicken burger, chips and a side salad). 
The mini bar is reasonably priced and is all computerised so anything you take out is charged automatically to your room. 
Overall, it was one of the best hotel stays we’ve had.

4238,United States of America,Superior Twin Room with Internal View,3  ,December 2018,Group," The hotel was perfect for what I was looking for:
Room: Internal View Twin - very comfortable, more than enough space for two people traveling. Only down side is it being internal unable to tell the time of day. This was both good and bad for Jetlag. Next time I would opt for a room with an outside view.
Bathroom: HUGE! Both walk in shower as well as tub with shower handle to wash off after soaking. Toilets are nice and overall very happy with the bathrooms.
Restaurants: Daily enjoyed the breakfast buffet, AMAZING. As an american that has never had ""English breakfast"" it was nice to have the buffet to ""try"" some of the signature dishes, but on days I wanted plain american breakfast I had that option too. 
I also had the chance to try the coffee shop (6/10) always very busy and staff seemed to move at a slower pace. Even getting water took about 15 minutes. But it was a nice reminder that I was on vacation and to relax.
I also enjoyed the onsite French restaurant - AMAZING (10/10) Both service, price, and food were perfect. I enjoyed the prix fix menu and would highly recommend to anyone to try at least one night. 
Check in: Fast, easy and friendly. Elevators are secure. Doors have staff to ensure all guests belong so it felt very safe",10.0,The perfect hotel for your London stay.,0,1,location|comfort|bathroom|restaurant|food|drink|staff|dirty|price|,1

The hotel happens to have two extremes of rooms: the cheapest ones face the atrium wall and may have no view and sunlight at all, leading to a rather uncomfortable, claustrophobic vibe; whereas the more upscale rooms are beautiful and truly represent what the hotel has to offer. Food was great quality, staff friendly, and location is perfect. Note for any guest planning to book the big ben view, it is under renovation (not sure until when) so dont waste your money on this view.

The hotel itself is very close to all the main attractions: Connects to westminister bridge so you can literally walk out of your hotel and onto the bridge, walking distance from Southbank which has a lot to do and London eye - and although longer, and if the weather permits and you're not too exhausted you can also walk to further attractions.

5282,United Kingdom,One-Bedroom Family Suite,2  ,August 2020,Family," To tell the truth, this was unfortunately one of my most uncomfortable stays I’ve ever had. Don’t get me wrong the suit i was in was beautiful and had an amazing view but staying there for 2 days began to affect my mental health. Countless times I felt like I was being targeted by staff members due to being black. On more than one occasion entering the building, I was picked out from a group of people and asked to show my room key. The first time I didn’t think much of it but it started to happen more and more. My friend who doesn’t really understand white privilege or racism didn’t notice at first but then she started to when it kept happening. I was one of the only black people staying there and when walking in, I was always the ONLY black person and the only person asked for the key. It was very difficult to deal with especially when I had paid £460 for the room and an additional £100 deposit that was never mentioned prior to booking. I hope that others do not experience what I have and I hope that they do something about this because people shouldn’t be treated any different due to the colour of their skin. I shouldn’t dread walking in and out of a hotel especially one with such a big name. Staff must be trained in how to not discriminate",1.0,Bad,0,1,location|staff|tv|price|,1

My boyfriend and I left for lunch and came back around 1. We were locked out. We went down to ask the receptionist what was going on she said it was because we were meant to check out. Her attitude towards us was awful I wish I took her name and complained. Yesterday when she was checking in a white couple her attitude was so much better. It’s a shame. Anyways she gave us a new card and I asked her if she needed the old ones and she just shaked her head. I could tell she didn’t want to talk to us. Going to check out later on she had the same attitude I didn’t want to go to her so I lined up to go to the same person that checked me in. She then came out and asked to check me out.

As I travel to London a lot, I was going to use this hotel every time I came back but I have changed my mind. We had 2 rooms as there are 5 members of my family, 1 room was fine, it was clean. Then the other was extremely disappointing, no hygiene seals like there usually is, crumpled rubbish on the bed, claw marks/scratches and smear marks all over the headboard. Staff were really helpful and moved us to an upgraded room but the only let down is that they moved us from a superior room with a super king size bed to a room with a seating area and a regular sized bed. I was very grateful but I had chosen the large bed for a reason and I would have preferred to be put into a room with the same size bed.

Unfortunately you did not achieve  this, ease take my criticism  as constructive on the following  points:
The welcome was far to casual and upon confirming and we have not been there before we were still not sat to a table or giving an explanation of service. 
The breakfast  buffet layout was uninnovative and slightly  boring with the layout with 3 service assistants all unaware in the correct terminology of addressing customers in English within the catering service industry. 
As for the food I was very disappointed that all the bacon was extremely  overcooked and the eggs were the liquid variety and not natural and the taste in this is extremely  noticeable and for somebody like myself who values a traditional  hot English breakfast I was extremely  upset with what I received, there was no toast available and only upon my exit did I notice the toaster was in a separate dinning area, you provided small  bowls of precut fruit as a yogurt topper but no yogurt was available and to finish off the coffe machine calibration to the size of your coffe mug does not fill to the top level which added to the all the small detail missed by you that affects the service level which is expected from such a well known  brand and beautiful  building. 
At no point during the hour spent at the breakfast  table did anybody complete a service check, speak to me or clear used items pushed aside from my table but the staff seemed very focused of clearing tables when customers  vacated .",9.0,Wonderful,1,0,food|staff|location|drink|price|comfort|,1

6911,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room with Internal View,1  ,August 2020,Solo traveler," Not keen on the purchase of this hotel, only for the fact that there are a lot of hidden charges they don’t tell you about. It’s the fine print but it’s should be in BOLD. The £50 deposit wasn’t relayed to me until I got there, this is not clearly found on their site so be careful. Also there was sweets/drinks in the fridge, nowhere did it say you have to pay or had any  prices.. which meant I lost most of my deposit based on that. 
I’m not saying the hotel. The staff are polite and it’s very clean, perfect location BUT the hidden charges are unecessary and I believe the staff should make customers aware when they check in (I.e list of prices for the items in the room). It’s very easy to believe it’s free when you have wine, cans of pops, sweets just sitting in your hotel room without requesting it and no price list! Ironically when I checked out they had a price list at their desk so I would ask for that first! Also the £50 deposit should be written in BOLD not fine print. I believe it’s a great hotel but very money hungry, they wasn’t really concerned with my finances and the deposit takes a few days to go back in your account (not given an exact day) which shows me they care more about the money and will charge customers with hidden charges at last minute if you are not careful.

The hotels thermal scanner was not working /functioning at entrance as advertised. We were lucky we left the Saturday or else it would have been too crowded for us to stay during a pandemic. Our check in was delayed the lady at the desk insisted I didn’t have a confirmed room with a view even though I had an email confirmation and had even been told over phone that we had a room with a london eye view. Eventually we got our room - london eye view at the 8th floor studio king was ok- we had a way better view from a room in a budget hotel last year.  The house keeping /staff who came to then set up the baby cot and sofa bed was very rude. He set up the sofa bed but clearly had no clue how to set up the cot - eventually someone else set it up. He was rude because I told him there was dust on the table - in his words ‘thats not my fault’.

This was made harder by the fact the phone in our room wasn't working. We were also surprised to see the spa full of screaming, very young children.

7114,Israel,Superior Double Room with Internal View,2  ,February 2020,Group," 1. After a long travel, the least you'd expect from the hotel, is a complimentary water at the room - but it wasn't there! I guess this policy makes the hotel a few more pennies a day, but it's outrageous to my opinion!..
2. For the price paid, omelettes at breakfast should be included in the price.
3. We had 4 rooms under the same reservation, and though check-in took about 15 minutes, but after the long travel we had it felt like ages. I've been to hotels before, and I understand the hotel's need to have somekind of a guarantee, but I think it's more than enough to fill a single application for the 4 of us and our offer to take the security deposit for all the rooms at once wasn't really complicated. I don't blame the receptionist, but I do blame the management for failing in this small point.
4. At the hotel bar, we encountered a rude waiter. We opened a table with a big tab, but when one of our group had a drink from outside and asked for Ice he was rudely answered that his drink is not from the hotel's bar and that he can't serve him Ice, though everything else on the table was ordered from there!.. 
5. Wi-Fi reception was extremely weak once you step outside the hotel's entrance, had almost no signal at the smoking area, which is 2 steps outside.

I told him I was checking in and had a reservation and asked him repeatedly where was the check in desk was. He told me he had to see my reservation before entry. I showed him and he proceeded to look through my email and gave my phone back and told me “I’m sorry we are fully booked”. I told him again I had a reservation and again asked him where the front desk was. He had a attitude and said “up there”. As I went up he followed me and lingered behind me the whole time until I finished checking in. He stood near the lobby/ elevator area until i got on. He made me feel extremely uncomfortable, unsafe and unwelcomed.
Thank God I had a great experience with the front desk Manager who was checking me in.
Later that day I went to the pool around 8:30pm. There was no one at the desk so I followed the signs and went into the ladies changing room to get ready to take a swim. The lady who worked there was in the dressing room and asked me to leave the room. I told her I was trying to go to the pool and she said I had to leave and told me to go to the Men’s changing room. I told her about 3 times I am a female but she insisted I belonged in the men’s room because I have short hair and continued to walk me out. I got a bit aggravated that’s when she backed off and “apologised” I was embarrassed she did that in front of people in the dressing room because I still had to go back in and change. When I was done she came in looking at me weird while I was changing. My shirt was off I felt a bit violated. When I was walking out she asked if I signed in. I told her There was no one here when i came in so i didn’t know I had to. So when I went to sign in she rudely said “well you don’t have to do it now”.",9.6,Mixed feelings,1,0,location|fitness|,1

Breakfast items lack dairy and gluten menu, and the special items can be requested at a premium. 
Staff at kitchen and room service not English spoken hence need to rely on their managers, which is a bit of a let down if you’re paying a big sum for the stay.

The breakfast receptionists were okay but they told me there were no vegan options available and that I should have made a request at the reception. So I went there and the reception informed me that I should have made a request at least 48 hours in advance. I told them that everything was confirmed through e-mail but apparently that wasn't enough. They told me I would only be able to get vegan breakast on the day of departure, so I said yes. And of course, again, there was no vegan breakfast provided. I ate strawberry preserves and baked beans for 5 days at breakfast, which is totally unacceptable, not least because of the price.
Also, the translation for the room type on booking was wrong. We had reserved a room with a view of surroundings and got one with an internal view. When we realised that the translation from English to Slovenian was wrong, we contacted Booking and they contacted the hotel but there was no answer of any kind. We could not explain any of this to the receptionist because he wasn't a good English speaker so we had to pay extra for an upgrade. I was very disappointed because this was not our mistake and also not our problem, but the hotel made zero effort to help us.

If you are offered an upgrade with a city view - don't.
The final bill that you get charged when you've already left was is USD, even though I specifically asked for GBP, and the precharge was in GBP.  Double conversions cost money, in my case it was around 50 GBP.

The reason being that hotel was overbooked!! Well I wasn't expecting that answer after paying £255 in advance for the that. Finally I got the keys after 15 min because I was 'lucky' and she found a vacant suite.
Also paying £50 extra for the city view was useless because I was under the impression that it would be facing BigBen.

However, my husband and I were pleased by Park Plaza westminster mainly because of the room, bathroom and the location, although some things should improve. 
The cons: Staff at check in was rather flat and impersonal, a very young lady with not much experience, didn’t make the best impression to us, and so did the woman in charge of the breakfast who didn’t even speak good English, what a shame... Breakfast was the worst aspect of this hotel experience as scrambled eggs taste was not good and coffee was terrible. Another negative aspect, sending people to the lower, underground floors to have breakfast, unacceptable for a hotel with 5star standards, fortunately we found a table at the Brasserie all 6 days in a row but the ambience and set up was really disturbing, waiting in long queues. As for the room, the design and layout is great at the King Studio, especially for a couple with two kids as the two sleeping areas are separated by the bathroom but there was a torn and worn leather chair at the desk and this seemed so unfit. Finally, housekeeping was spotless only on 2 of the 7 days of our stay, the remaining 5 the room was left almost unattended and this was probably because of the full occupancy during Christmas holiday season.",7.1,A great value for money stay in the best London area,1,0,bathroom|location|staff|food|drink|comfort|bed|,1

I also had an issue with one of the security guards on Saturday night. My friends and I were having a drink at the bar and I went out for a cigarette and when I came back in I did not have my room card.

Feel sadly let down by this hotel although they eventually sorted rooms but on different floors so family split up , I asked for upgrade of breakfast out of good will and they would not even do that !!! Not good customer service by any means , so now I will not be returning to this hotel of which is a very disappointing experience yet again .

9270,Finland,Superior Double Room with Internal View,1  ,October 2018,Solo traveler, I have never had to queue for breakfast before and this was stressful as I had an important meeting after it. My electronic key stopped working in the morning so I could not get in after breakfast and I wasn’t allowed to go in after the key was changed but had to wait for a guard even though I had my Mastercard with me. The guard said it should have been enough to show my identity. I did keep the card away from my phone so I don’t understand why it stopped working. All in all there were too many time consuming waitings in the morning. Breakfast didn’t have enough options for those who cannot use cow’s milk and eat glutein,9.0,Comfortable Hotel needs more work to become excellent,1,0,food|tv|,0

However, when we went to check out nothing was placed on the system so the receptionist knew nothing about the matter, and we were also told there is not a refund form and we had eaten the breakfasts and then they were taken away. I was furious and asked for a manager who later confirmed this was not true and said they would investigate the situation further and then get a refund, I feel cheated! Lastly, we had an item missing from our room after it had been cleaned. The item was a little octopus bear that was pink and easy to spot. The cleaners had said that it must have got caught up in the bed sheets and there is nothing they can do. I had brought this for my girlfriend and it meant a lot to her as she suffers from mental health and the octopus can be flipped to tell me her mood. I am really not happy about this and do expect some kind of compensation as I had even booked an extra night at the hotel to the next day be faced with all these issues I didn’t need.

Upon entry, the security noticed that there was no cigarette smell in my room and that it might’ve been a false complaint.
This intrusion of privacy and violation of personal space made me feel really uncomfortable at the hotel especially since the security was aggressive in his entry and all the staff at the hotel defended it as ‘hotel policy’. I believe that this hotel’s policy is harmful to their customers and extremely impolite. The way you are treated there is devoid of any human respect and they disregard the emotional damage caused by their violent actions. 
I advise no one to go through what I went through by boycotting this hotel and standing up to basic human rights.

Plastic glasses and paper cups in the room for coffee and tea was very substandard. 
The fact that the rooms weren’t cleaned and checked the following day was dreadful. We had to call for toiletries (only enough for 1 shower!) and tea and coffee.
The desk area and parts of the lounge area were dirty.
The breakfast area again was like a poorly run cafe with pathetic excuses of scraps of tick box paper to order breakfast! The breakfast was dreadful with poor quality eggs and sausages, lack of taste and overcooked bacon. We had to have sachets of sauces and salt just to add insult to injury.
We cancelled our second day breakfast on our first day at the desk. Later that evening we checked on the TV as to the balance of our account. The charge for the following day breakfast was still included. My husband called reception and apparently it was rectified. 
We walked a short distance to ‘Giraffe’ on the Queens Walk and had an amazing breakfast with excellent service.
We tried to do an express (joke) checkout in the room but after 20 minutes of issues I contacted main reception. On the TV the account amount was correct. The woman on the reception did the checkout for me over the phone.
When we were in the taxi leaving I checked my email and had 2 invoices for the correct amount and an extra one for charges for the breakfast we hadn’t had! I called them and was passed from pillar to post with no apologies and almost accusing us for not cancelling the breakfast in the first place! After being put on hold while they were trying to speak to various members of staff for 20 minutes I asked them to call me back.

The restaurant for breakfast was nice, food ok.

I asked for vegetarian sausages and got it so was happy, mushrooms abit weird as they were bitter and sweet at the same time so I didnt eat them.
The only gripe I have is that I asked for water for the kettle so I could have a cup of tea late at night and was told to use the tap water in the bathroom. I dont drink water from my bathroom and would not dream of filling up my kettle at home to give a friend or family member a cup of tea. I asked for plain tap water for the kettle from the kitchen and was told it would cost £5 for someone to bring it to my room, outrageous!!!!!!, I then told the receptionist I would come downstairs with my kettle if they could fill it for me I would be happy.

We were also not ever made aware that the valet parking was not actually available (as it was being used for NHS staff - brilliant gesture by the way), and that the car would be left overnight on the road outside the hotel, but charged the same amount. 
We booked the hotel for our 5 year anniversary and when I messaged the hotel to ask for something to be done, they replied saying how fantastic it was that I had booked for my daughter which I do not have(?!!).

To us, a kitchenette means that there is at least a mini-refrigerator -- which we needed and specifically chose the room for in order to store medication that needed to be refrigerated. When we got to the room, there was something that appeared to be refrigerator, but it seemed to be broken because it was basically room temperature. After calling down and reporting it as broken, we were told that this is not a 'refrigerator' -- but, instead, a 'cooler' (Zoltan and Samantha - staff who we engaged with) that only cooled at about room temperature (what good is that?).  Perhaps they thought we were being difficult, but we explained that we specifically chose the hotel because of the kitchenette and we didn't even think that we needed to ask if there was at least a refrigerator that cooled properly. Since we definitely needed a refrigerator and didn't want to store important medication with the staff at the front office (the medication needed to be used several times per day), we were told that the only thing they could do was to offer a higher price studio for 60 pounds extra per night. Unhappily, we took the offer only because we were desperate for a refrigerator and had several medical appointments that we didn't want to be jeopardized by trying to find a new hotel room and perhaps not getting refunded. To me, the booking advertisement should be changed to at least define what they mean when they say kitchenette (for example, state that there is only a 'room temperature cooler' and not a 'refrigerator', very limited kitchenware (two sets of cutlery), no plates and no glasses or cups (only plastic ones in the bathroom), and no stovetop or pots and pans. I thought that this advertisement on booking was definitely misleading and we 100 percent would not have stayed there had the description been honest and accurate.",6.0,Felt misled by the hotel and disappointed with customer service response,1,0,drink|restaurant|temperature|staff|price|food|bathroom|,1

After taking over an hour to get checked in and dealing with your rude security staff upon entering the building. It didn’t take me long to realise there are no facilities open at the moment inside your hotel.. so after waiting patiently for around half an hour to get a lift to pick us up and take us to the fifth floor... we found our room exhausted by all the check in nonsense and Practically having to fight for a lift.. it was left with bins still not emptied from prior guests and dirty toilet roll behind the toilet.. I passed a cleaner in the hallway so went back out to inform him he looked at me smiled and didn’t even take the bin off me so I just sat it in the hallway along with the half empty trays of food dotted outside rooms they stayed there until I checked out the next day...I would not expect this at a 3 star B&B outside of COVID-19 times let alone when we’re in the middle of a global pandemic! Utterly embarrassing! So let’s fast forward to around midnight.. upon ordering a film to watch with my partner we decided we wanted to use room service for some ice cream... nice thought that was because after not answering for 20 minutes and 3 phone calls.. I finally got through to someone only to be told that there was an hour and half wait for room service... for ice cream!! Pathetic to say the least! How this hotel is 4 stars is completely beyond me! I’ve had camping trips with more amenities and facilities! Stay clear and avoid at all costs waste of time and money! This was meant to be a romantic stay for our anniversary it turned out to be a nightmare to forget! (See pictures of dirty filled bin left in room) Hilton hotel and county hall offer nicer places WITH facilities to use and similar price!

There was no any understanding that we could receive for ex. min one room that our children can go and we can came in next 1 hour to finish registration or we can make authorization for payment - but not final payment. NO - we need to pay all and unfortunately not in local currency. There was no proposal  for solution in this situation, the lady in reception was unbelievable rude and we need to stay all  5 person next 30 min not like a guest but like a poor people without money on account. Never again. So the first view was not good but was only worst next day. After one night in this 4 star hotel (!!) one of our children was very strongly bitten by bedbugs in legs and bellow, I put claim and we received new room without one word sorry, till the end of our stay nobody come to us and explain what was happened and not sorry us for this what happened!

Upon on arrival to room 747 no sofa bed was ready and there was no cot and no luggage. Called guest services to let them know immediately and they said they will send someone now ASAP guess what 25 minutes later and no one came and no call to apologise for delay. We call again and get told someone will arrive soon. Again noting we call call again and third time we get someone to room finally after one hour to do sofa bed & cot bed arrives. But guess what no luggage still we then call again get informed that one of us has to go down ourself to collect bags and confirm room numbers !!! Seriously it made no sense. Very disappointing to be honest. 
Also please note  breakfast buffet style but  is very basic eggs Are not well cooked more like soggy scrambled eggs taste watery!! Not much options either you have toast , beans , bacon etc and cold option is very limited items. 
On check out I gave my key back and wasn’t even asked how was your stay just shows how much they care about customer services. I tried to share what happend to me but no one was listening either so I gave up.

Shoe mitts were placed in the bathroom and shower cap was located in the wardrobe next to the shoe rack and also having the breakfast request menu already filled out by the previous guest set out on the bed! Went to the main desk and shared the problems we had in the room, we were then moved to another room of the same standard to then have a mini bar that was unable to be opened even after having staff out to try and resolve the problem it left us with no access to it for the whole duration of our stay but was still somehow charged for items on our invoice which we clearly did not have! Lastly, the second room we were moved to had a bath with a plug that didn’t drain the water due to the lever not releasing the plug resulting in the bath remaining still full!

She told me he was probably referring to the ""hotel policy""- which is that you cannot leave your children if they are under 16. He was not. He said ""English law."" And that's a ridiculous policy.

10159,Ireland,Superior Double Room,1  ,October 2019,Couple," This weekend, we checked into the hotel as business guests to get some rest after a manic week and specifically make use of the spa facilities. It was our first time in the hotel. Unfortunately, our experience was far from relaxing from the moment we stepped through the door. Despite paying extra on booking.com for an upgraded room, we were given a room that looked out on to concrete walls and told an upgrade to see the river would be £90. We were then told we need to 'book a slot' to use the swimming pool as the hotel was busy. Slightly puzzled, we booked a slot at 5pm and went to get something to eat whilst we waited for our allocated slot. Once we did go down to the spa area, we were unable to use the pool as it was packed to kids. Of course, children are welcome to use the facilities, but it would definitely be helpful if there were more slots for adult only use. (Currently only 8-10pm at night). We tried to lie back and read, but it was impossible with all the screaming, and we were also not allowed to use phones because of the children in the pool. This hotel is in line price wise with other 4 and 5star hotels in the area but it is way below par. We travel lots globally with work and this was the least pleasant stay we have had in a long time. On the sat night, after our experience in the spa, we reported our experience to a very friendly and understanding lady on guest relations. She was helpful and listened and said she would speak to a manager to see what could be done. However, when we returned the next morning, a different clerk said there was nothing that could be done.

The breakfast was like feeding time at the zoo.. it was soo busy and the choice was fairly limited and lots of things designed to cut costs.. tiny glasses, tiny portions of mixed chopped fruit, limited bread selection it was very disappointing for the price. There were no plugs alongside the bed which was a pain for charging my phone. I had to queue for breakfast as it was crazy busy. The glass I used was chipped which I felt was dangerous. It was hard to find plates at bowls at the buffet. The towels in the bed room had black stains on them. The room was really very dark. The reading light above the bed was set in the ceiling which was really uncomfortable as soft lighting if you just want to pop to the loo in the night or wind down in the evening. The condiments in the bathroom were limited. The breakfast made it feel like a budget hotel.. for the price of £220 I thought that wasn’t good enough! The giant shrek made the place look really tacky and cheap! I was annoyed to be given a twin room as I was travelling without my partner and had deliberately booked a superior double room.. so had to go back to the desk and change rooms which took some time.

10227,United Kingdom,Studio King (Family),2  ,August 2019,Family," I had previously stayed at this hotel and enjoyed my stay. However, the service on this occasion was very poor and not what I would expect of a 4* hotel. When I arrived at the check in desk there was one person in front of me. Others arrived and formed another queue. A member of staff arrived with a clip board and came over to me and the girl in front of me and insisted that we join the back of the other queue. I am disabled and use a walking aid. It would be obvious that standing for any length of time would cause me difficulty. It took over 20 minutes standing before I was served. Initially I was told the booking was for a double room. I had to prove showing my booking confirmation that I had booked a studio king. I asked for a room on the 2nd floor as I have difficulty with stairs and would struggle to evacuate the hotel in an emergency. 
After having to queue again at reception at 2pm for another 10 minutes, I was told the room was not ready and eventually, after complaining, I was given a room on the 6th floor which was dangerous for someone with mobility issues . I was told that a room on the 2nd floor would not be ready until between 4 - 5pm as they were ""very busy"". 
The room lacked basics such as towels and tissues. I tried to ring reception to ask for items but there was no answer. This did not improve on the second day after room service had cleaned the room. The last time I stayed in this hotel, the room was supplied with dressing gowns and slippers, but not on this occasion.
We ordered lunch in the bar and my meal arrived cold. I had to carry my plate over to a member of staff as I was being ignored to ask for the food to be replaced. When it was eventually returned it was set in front of me without an apology. 
In summary, this was the poorest service I have received at any hotel. The two night stay cost me £670 and was definitely not worth it.",5.4,"Very disappointing, not worth the cost. Do not stay here if you are disabled!",1,0,staff|bathroom|food|drink|restaurant|,0

2. In order to hook up my medical device (CPAP breathing machine) at night, I had to crawl on the floor to disconnect the phone to use its outlet.
3. Hotel does not provide extension cords or electrical adapters.
4. Cannot unplug the floor lamp for other uses. The hotel engineer explained that was because the floor light was made in India with Indian plugs (Type D) and the outlets on both sides of the bed are Type D to match. UK plugs (Type G) will not fit in them.
2. There was only one short towel rack that doubles as a handicap grab bar and there is very little counter space in the bathroom. The maid leaves the fresh towels on the counter, reducing further the counter space.
3. Shower has no curb (possibly because this was a handicap room), so water splashes far into the bathroom, even if I'm very careful.
4. Most of the bedroom lighting comes from narrow beam spotlights in the ceiling aimed at the bed and desk. This leaves half of the room in darkness.
5. The bathroom door is glass so if I go to the bathroom at night, the light shines out into the room and wakes up my wife.
6. Very difficult reaching the toilet paper behind the toilet, so we removed it from the dispenser.
7. The light over the bathroom mirror are also spot lights angled vertically downward, which exaggerates facial wrinkles.
8. The magnifying make-up mirror attached to the wall is about 9 inches too low for an average woman.

We booked the second room with 2 separate beds. Of course we received a room with one double bed instead. 
Breakfast was disaster. Very noisy, food quality was mediocre, it was a huge hall in which hundrads of people were walking around - you couldn't get your breakfast coffee with a peace of mind. 
The elavators to the floors were always very busy. We could sometimes wait over 10 minutes to be able to join the ride.

10341,Romania,Studio King (Family),5  ,May 2019,Family," Where to start with?
1. First of all the hotel is charging a deposit - 300 GBPs for me and my 5 years old kid for 5 nights.
I checked out on 5th. Today is Tuesday, 7th, and my 300 GBP is still blocked. They should release the deposit on check out date and not one week after. Their a Hotel, God Damn, and not a Bank.
I had the same situation last year with Plaza on The River.
2. I have booked a King Studio Family Room which is not the cheapest.
When first checked in I received the worst room on a corner of the building with no view whatsoever and smelling like cigarettes. And that is in a non-smoking hotel.
Went back to check in desk. The lady there was a little confused but nice and willing to help. I asked for a room with a little view as this is the reason why I didn't booked the cheapest room in the beginning. 
She only could upgrade my room view if I pay 100 extra GBP. Fine. I paid. I got the most amazing room view on top of Westminster Bridge. Room 767.
3. The Pool - different story - you need to book your time and you can only stay for 30 minutes. It's true that I did not got kicked out after 30 minutes.
4. Breakfast - Absolutely Terrible and the same each morning. A breakfast for a motel, and not for a 4 Stars Hotel.

10369,Taiwan,Studio Twin,10  ,April 2019,Group," I specifically chose Park Plaza due to its location and star rate. 
However, I am deeply disappointed after my stay. 
The quality does not correspond to the price.
1. We made a trip in vain with our heavy luggage because the guidance staff on the ground floor led us to the wrong direction.
2. The receptionist at the front desk is too impatient to explain to us what option we had on housekeeping.
3. The door hanger falls off every time when opening the door. As a star-rated hotel, do you not have any better options?
4. When is the last time you flip or replace the mattress? It sags.
5. I understand that the work of housekeeper is hard. However, how could you forget to replace/refill the amenities all the time? The housekeepers even hid the tissue box behind towels and did not provide tissue paper. Does this mean we shall not use tissue paper anymore? Cotton swab, shampoo and shower gel were provided occasionally based on their mood, until they decide not to provide them anymore. Towels and bath towels were not replaced by new ones (used ones were placed in the bath tub, since the floor was too dirty). The housekeepers did not care about customers’ needs at all. Also, the floor and desk was not cleaned or wiped during the weekend cleaning.
6. The dry cleaning service provided by Park Plaza is not professional. One of my shirt got stained, and the other one got a burned spot on it.
7. Do not ask the receptionist any question, because she would be impatient and roll her eyes at you.
8. The light fixture, sofa and hangers were worn or stained and shall be cleaned or replaced.

I have never come across such rude and uninterested staff in the bar area in my life. All the girls who served us were unfriendly and simply unhelpful. No eye contact, no smile, we were even called liars when they got the orders wrong supplying 2 coffees not 1. Marina was the worst offender but they were all a disgrace. The carpet in this area is also a disgrace , filthy dirty. I can only assume this part of the hotel is run by different people to the hotel itself which was of a reasonable standard.
The receptionist did not email us when our room was ready as promised when we tried to book in early. She was too busy trying to upsell us to a better room - we hade already spent enough on 3 nights thanks!
When we joined the queue for the second time as the booking in time was well past that advertised the second receptionist was doing ok until she asked me if I would be able to find my way out in the event of a fire. when I replied yes she asked me to sigh a form and disappeared to get one. On her return I asked why I had been asked this as never before has this question arisen she said ' I noticed you have difficulty walking'  I was furious and insulted and in fact when recanting this to friends later I burst into tears. I do have a slight walking limp due to knee issues but was unaware that this made me an invalid. I swim every day, I play Badminton 2 hours a week, I play table tennis 6 hours a week and walk 8 miles every day. How rude was she? I am still furious and offended.
The practice of charging 12.5% service charge is ridiculous on everything you buy. Either be honest with your prices or wait to be offered a gratuity. It is embarrassing to have to ask for it to be taken off and I heard people moaning about it the whole weekend.

Breakfast was appaling, after first day experience we made a desicion to take it at a nearby Pret a Manger instead (even though  we had it prepaid with our booking) Staff in general were friendly and helpful, but hotel bar  manager Martin was quite rude. We had two 5 year old boys by our table, and naturally it was quite hard to keep them sat down. They were running around our tabble (not interfering with other peoples evening) which was fine, as there was quite a lot of space as the bar was not crowded at all. The manager came over and asked us to keep the kids sat down, which was unusual, especially for the hotel advertising itself as ‘family friendly’ as they were not interfering with anyone. When we pointed that out to him, he said something like ‘I dont care about you at all, it is dangerous for the kids to run around like that and gave some examples about hot soup which could somehow be spilled on them. All of this was happening ~5-6pm. Other small disadvantage- there is no ‘in-hotel’ car park, only a valet prking option, which means that your car is being taken to an off-site car park. It can take up to 30 mins to get the car if you need it. In general, my advice- if you are on a budget, it is an ok hotel, but I personally would rather stay further away from the city centre and pay the extra £10 for the cab than stay here again. I’ve previously stayed in the Double Tree and Thistle chains (same price level) which are much better/more convienient allround.

Notwithstanding to mention, the Japanese restaurant called Ichi, that I asked at 4 pm on25th December, about if it was necessary to reserve a table; the hostess informed me that it wasn't necessary,  because the service it will be provided by order of arrival. Therefore, I went to my room and while I was there; by two times, attendants from the restaurant, bothered my wife, who was at the lobby seating and looking into her mobile. They said that we would have to have dinner 5:30 and leave the restaurant at 7:00 pm. If we would like to have dinner on that day.  Of course, she refused and asked the attendant, whoever in that lobby would take that proposal? Of course, nobody.

Bearing in mind there was no way they were going to sell any more rooms for that night as it was gone midnight, there was no attempt to resolve the situation apart from insisting on the £25 payment.  I agreed in the end but then said I would be making a complaint.  It was only then that she asked me to hold as she must have gone to speak with someone.   She then came back and said she would upgrade.   For the sake of £25 the hotel left a bad customer experience.  Not what you would expect from a radisson group hotel.
