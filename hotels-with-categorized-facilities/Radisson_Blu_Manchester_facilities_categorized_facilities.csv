However there is a very elegant looking restaurant/bar on site should you wish to dine. The biggest selling point however is the closeness to the terminals. Terminal 2 being a mere couple of minutes walk away, Terminals 1 and 3 being 5-7 minutes walk at most. The Radisson Blu is the perfect hotel for a pre-flight stay. Reception staff have always been extremely friendly and informative. I have stayed at this hotel many times and would absolutely recommend it to those travelling from Manchester Airport.",10.0,Perfect pre-flight hotel.

This hotel is truly amazing, shame we only stay for one night always after our holiday.  Many thanks for a positive experience following our holiday.

Don't bother! The breakfast was nothing to get excited about. Also, it was not explained beforehand that dinner would only be offered from a VERY limited menu (called the Bed and Breakfast option when I checked in). Only 4 options to pick from for main entree. It did offer Starter, Entree and desert. The started I chose was the Caesar salad, a real joke of 7-10 lettuce leaves with dressing. Since I stayed 2 nights, my choices were very limited. Don't expect to order from the regular menu! Ordered the bacon cheeseburger the first night. Hamburgers in the restaurant came in 3 sizes. My option was only the smallest on the menu. I DID pay for these meals, but I felt like the hotel/restaurant thought they were giving me my meals for free. Second night, had the Fish and Chips. Have you ever had lukewarm fried food? Well, that's what it was. The regular items being served at tables all around me looked very hot, tasty and worthy of a Radisson Restaurant.

Don't expect to order from the regular menu! Ordered the bacon cheeseburger the first night. Hamburgers in the restaurant came in 3 sizes. My option was only the smallest on the menu. I DID pay for these meals, but I felt like the hotel/restaurant thought they were giving me my meals for free. Second night, had the Fish and Chips. Have you ever had lukewarm fried food? Well, that's what it was. The regular items being served at tables all around me looked very hot, tasty and worthy of a Radisson Restaurant. Just don't expect it if you get the breakfast and dinner package.",7.9,Convenient.,1,bed

So as not to miss my long haul flight i struggled to walk alone through security. That was a real challenge as without the chair, I had to stand in a long queue for a long time.

We went back to reception so she offered us a further upgrade to executive room on 9th floor - our key did not give us access to exec lounge and the room was smaller than the superior room and had a shower and no bath it also over looked the car park instead of the runway view we had paid for so am hoping when we come over next month that we don't get offered an upgrade as superior room is far nicer than the exec room.,7.5,On the whole fabulous stay as always just disappointed in the room,0,parking

United Kingdom,Executive Room with Lounge Access,1,June 2019,Couple," To be honest the rest of the staff were unfriendly, unsmiling and couldn't care less, particularly the bar and Restaurant Managers. We had ordered cocktails and as they take a while to make we had ordered another. As I put my empty glass down the bar Manager arrived and asked if we were ordering another. He didn't seem to believe me when I told him we had, luckily the waiter arrived with our drinks. There was no greeting or smile just a sales push I didn't appreciate. By the way when you are paying £9 for a cocktail the glass should be full.
  This is the second time we have eaten in the Restaurant. Breakfast is nice but this is the second time the food at dinner has been dreadful. The pate was horrible dense, bitter, with soggy toast, no chutney. We were not asked how we would like our main meals cooked which were completely over cooked when they arrived.  My burger was so dry and over cooked I couldn't eat it. I asked the unfriendly waiter for another as I couldn't swallow it without taking a drink.  The Manager who was unsmiling and unfriendly asked what was wrong and I explained it was burnt and over cooked and asked for another, medium. The second burger was worse it was even more over done, when you cut it in half and squeezed there was no moisture. The Manager apologized and asked if I wanted another. I declined as any even I can cook burgers better than that. We had hoped the food had improved since our last visit but it hasn't.",8.3,Disapointing,0,staff

It was from the set menu. First course  chicken wings with dip very good and served nice and hot. I said if the next courses  be s nice meal But sadly  that was not the case I chose  the burger. Well presented but it wss over done and very dry  it was like eating cardboard. The bun was done to s crisp and not easy to get a knife through As for the rasher of bacon that was hard extremely  over cooked,It could of been done at Breakfast  and wss left over The chips was nice but as for the burger I could of got a better burger in Burger  King. I told the waiter and showed s bit of burger to him and showed how it broke up in prices as I touched  it. All he could say or our burgers are well done. I said  that's fine but they should have moisture  within them this is like eating  cardboard
The desert  I asked if was a backed cheesecake  he replied  it's not hot.
We both had that it arrived nice presentation  with raspberries  and a sauce  drizzled  over no ice cream or cream.It wss differently not baked.it was a biscuit  base√ filled with a mouse  type filling but it was not light it was firm, rubbery with far to much geletine. When eating it was cladding  inside your mouth.
I saw the matra De  (Supervisor )later she seemed to take it all in !! And went in some way of putting it right with a couple of glasses wine.
Also found out that they did not deliver your newspaper to your door outside but you had to get it from reception and the weighing scales  it's a 1.00pound. It's less money 20p for putting air in your tyres

United Kingdom,Premium Room,1,October 2020,Couple," Breakfast was very disappointing. The waitress who greeted us was friendly and helpful, took our order for coffee and when she brought the coffee took our orders for hot food. 
There was a buffet available with individual portions of cereals, fruits, muffins, ham, etc., but we decided to select the hot option. I chose the full English breakfast and toast, while my girlfriend chose the breakfast panini. After about 10 minutes the waitress returned to apologise and say that they had no paninis left and so took an order of sausage and scrambled egg as a substitute. 5 minutes later she returned with a panini and said the chef had managed to find one. She then reconfirmed my order 15 minutes after taking it and I had to wait another 5-10 minutes before it was served. The overall impression was of a kitchen that was badly disorganised.
Both options were not particularly good quality. The panini wasn’t toasted very well and didn’t appear to have any egg mayonnaise. The full English was all there, but none of it tasted particularly good. The coffee was also not particularly good. 
As we had arrived late the previous evening after a flight we hadn’t eaten dinner and so we’re looking forward to a tasty breakfast on Sunday morning before starting our long drive home.

We decided we weren’t going to sit there we went back to the desk and asked him for another table.  Another group were at that time complaining because they had visited the restaurant at 4pm to book their evening meal and had arrived to be told there was no booking.  We sat and waited for about 15 mins then were shown to another side room, meanwhile others were shown to the main dining room.  As far as I could see these were people who had turned up without a booking, were allocated a time then waited in the bar.  There was no apology, but there was an acknowledgement, after the man serving us went to check, that the person we had booked with had forgotten to write it down.  It is worth noting also that I had reserved a table on arrival to avoid sitting in one of the side rooms.

I asked if there is anyone can help and fix the sink because it was too full and could not use at all. He said no, the only thing is to change room. (at 12am?!)",5.4,Fair,0,staff
