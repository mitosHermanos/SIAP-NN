Despite being so central the hotel itself is a haven. It’s quiet, air conditioned, comfortable, and the staff are great. Raddison Blu are always good, add to that the Edinburgh charm and you’ve got someone you’ll wish you lived!

The evening took a turn when my partner became unwell with chest pain and we had to call an ambulance to the hotel, we informed staff of the situation and they were very attentive and helpful during a worrying time, the night manager (Tom I think?) came to us and introduced himself, he was very kind and let us know to contact him if we needed anything. The staff brought my partner water and eventually we were able to head up to our room after the drama.

I have stayed in a lot of hotels and this was one of the best EVER, staff were very friendly and welcoming and could not help enough. We arrived early and they took the luggage from us and when the room was ready took our luggage up, all while we explored Edinburgh without dragging our baggage with us. Bed was very comfortable and the room was spotless. Did not come across a single member of staff who was not smiling and courteous. An absolute credit to your company.

Australia,Royal Mile Suite,2,September 2018,Couple," First, the check-in staff were very good. We arrived very early and our room wasn't ready so they looked after our bags, organised some refreshments and arranged a tour for us. Similarly, when we needed a last minute dinner booking for Saturday night, concierge was able to recommend a very good restaurant and arrange a table for us. Thank you Kenneth!
The suite was gigantic with a separate lounge room and dining area. Bedroom was large also. Only point I'd make is they could have cut down on space in the hallway or lounge room to make the bathroom bigger - bit of a squeeze for two people simultaneously. Bed was very comfortable and linen nice and cosy for cold nights in Edinburgh!
The bar staff were friendly and hospitable with a good selection of drinks. The decor and appearance of the hotel are gorgeous and totally in keeping with the old town Royal Mile.

United Kingdom,Standard Room,1,October 2018,Family," Sadly our stay was not as memorable as it should be due to a fire drill during the night where the fire evacuation process was very poor. There were no correct evacuation process, no fire wardens on sight when we had to evacuate. I had to wake my young children and have to go down 6 flight of stairs into the freezing cold in the middle of the night. The most disturbing thing is that the fire alarm was triggered by someone smoking on site. To our disappointment, the hotel did not take into account the distress me and my young children had to face in the middle of the night out, having to risk going down these stairs while children were half asleep into the freezing cold, extremely frightened. The hotel took no responsibility to the distress and discomfort caused to my young children. 
We tried to ask for a refund for the distress and disturbance caused. The reason I am writing this review is not that of the false alarm and but the hotel management did not seem to be too concerned about our ordeal we faced or the fact the incidence could have cost us our lives.",5.8,Okay,1,location

The morning of the 6th we went down for breakfast to take to our room as soon as we arrived there was another member no very happy with his cutlery, we shrugged it off until we were seated to wait for our breakfast(to take to our room) we also noticed dirty cutlery at the table we were glad we were getting separate cutlery or I would’ve complained also, at current situations it’s no acceptable for a hotel of such high standards to not have clean cutlery,

Two nights later or so we actually went to the hotel bar, charge what we had to our room, left, were just getting settled when they called us because they couldn’t find our credit card on the system or something, we had to get back down and tried to sort it out, but the truth is we never understood what was wrong with the card they had entered when we checked in; they even asked if I wanted to put that charge on another credit card, which I said of course not, they had a credit card on their system and that was the card they should use for the charge.

Anyway, later one they ask for our property back, the bottle, because it was ours, but I wouldn’t have let them take it on the first place, if you don’t want your passengers drinking on your premises ask them to move it to the room or leave the space, but don’t touch what’s not your property.
Two nights later or so we actually went to the hotel bar, charge what we had to our room, left, were just getting settled when they called us because they couldn’t find our credit card on the system or something, we had to get back down and tried to sort it out, but the truth is we never understood what was wrong with the card they had entered when we checked in; they even asked if I wanted to put that charge on another credit card, which I said of course not, they had a credit card on their system and that was the card they should use for the charge.

Ireland,Superior Room,4,July 2019,Solo traveler, The people on the desk at check in could do with a personality makeover. The girl that checked me in I think was French I couldn’t tell exactly but by the few words she spoke. She never once looked at me. She was the most impersonal person. No she was actually downright rude and almost cost this hotel a good review. Don’t put rude people on your desks. There are a few of them at this hotel. The desk people are your ambassadors. You need better representation. Although the concierge desk gentleman was very nice and helpful. You could be five stars if you sent your deck people to training in how to deal with the public and customer service.,9.2,Fabulous location,0,staff

This wasn't a ""signature scent"" of the brand -- it's something commonly used to neutralize rooms and, in my case, brought on near-allergic reactions.  I remember the same scent being used in Aloft Hotels and in the Penguin, a cheap motel in South Beach.  But I digress.  The first room my business partner was assigned had that scent, and she couldn't be in it for more than a minute.  We asked for another room, which the hotel quickly gave us.  Thanks!  My point in all this -- there must be something else that can be used as this freshener, as it instantly brought ""cheap hotel"" to mind for me.

Also your table is cleared when you get up to get orange juice and cereal, this was virtually all that was offered for breakfast",5.0,High expectations of a blu standard hotel not realised,0,price

United Kingdom,Superior Room,2,September 2020,Couple, Cleanliness and housekeeping. Honeymoon weekend having just got married during Covid crisis. You would think cleanliness would be a priority. Booked a superior room. Was told it had been cleaned and was ready. Checked in and went to room. Having a look around as you do. Someone’s old dirty top was on the floor behind one of the chairs! Obviously not a thorough clean! I hat else hadn’t they checked or cleaned! Complained and moved rooms. Next day went out and again room was supposedly cleaned while we were out. However they had failed to change the pillowcases because it was still covered in make up from the night before! If they hadn’t changed those this meant they hadn’t changed the sheets at all as the pillow was on top. I go home also means they probably hadn’t cleaned the room again. The rooms are not cheap and this is supposed to be a quality hotel but housekeeping t had let you down twice. How can anyone be sure they are safe in your hotel In Times or Covid. I have emailed the company twice and had no response. Once while still there!! Very disappointed and put a dampener on the oi mi I honeymoon. It had been a stressful enough week with getting married and cancelled reception meaning hardly any family due to Covid. We did not have the luxury of postponing. We treated our selves to this break in o give us a good start to married life. I wouldn’t have thought dirty rooms would be on the agenda!!,1.0,Housekeeping needs to up their game and should be checked more!!,0,dirty

We appreciate that soft furnishings have had to be removed, but the advertised minibar was completely empty for no apparent reason. And the thick dust on the back of the couches is inexcusable. Our room was not cleaned during our stay and towels and shower gel etc., were not replenished. But to be fair this maybe down to COVID-19 restrictions.

I checked out and had forgotten my suit and shoes in the room. I returned a couple of hours later (same day) to collect it and was told that housekeeping couldn’t find it and so I had to fly home without it even though I knew it must of been in the building. Front of house hotel staff dealt with this matter appallingly - one member of staff even rolled her eyes and huffed and puffed at us when we said it was urgent as we had to catch a flight.
The hotel manager then stepped in and in all fairness was excellent, reassured us which was all you want as a paying customer. He said he would send me the suit when they found it (who knows how they couldn’t find it to start with being a hotel of their calibre) but anyway we left reassured we would be sent it if/ when it “showed up”.
Next day I received a call to say that they had located it and housekeeping had “put it to the side and gone home” as opposed to correctly logging it onto a system and putting it in lost property. Anyway they had my suit so that was some good news, until they tried to charge me £20-30 to post it back to me. After a stern conversation with the manager about my experience he called back to say he would send it for free.

However, when we got back the next day the receptionist was quite rude suggesting we had no idea what was going on and I did not know how to spell my own name which was quite insulting. The manager who we had to ask for was then lovely and knew the whole situation.  
Then we had to ask 5 times to have twin beds which was irritating, but the staff were lovely each time. They did offer us an upgrade and a free meal due to the disruption which was amazing. The meal was particularly good, but we only got drinks halfway through.

Canada,Standard Room,2,July 2019,Couple," Upon receiving an email offering an upgrade for purchase we agreed to a superior room for an extra £20 per night offering a view of Arthur’s Seat. 
Upon entering our room the  view was out of a window 2 feet square. Very small. Yes you could see Arthur’s seat but.....
The room smelled like a fire had been in the room. In the evening sitting on the bed and not touching it the bedside lamp fell off the wall. The night staff very quickly came up and fixed it
The next day when we were ready to go out and explore we went to use the safe and it didn’t work. A screw holding the outlet was just about out
There was mould on the window ledge. 
The head board which was metallic was almost worn off. 
We went and spoke with the manager Brian and he offered to go look at our room. When we got back there was a little fruit basket in the room. Safe still not fixed. Screw removed from the outlet but not fixed
No other contact from staff about the room other than a fruit basket which we received at 6pm and we were leaving the next day so not able to enjoy at all. 
This room was at most a 2-3 star room. Would not go back",5.8,Not a 4 star hotel,0,location

United Kingdom,Standard Room,1,October 2018,Couple," We booked this hotel stay to celebrate a milestone wedding anniversary. When using the pool/sauna facilities, the staff were rather ignorant and unhelpful when I pointed out that there was no water available and that there were piles of empty cups left around. This made me question the cleanliness of the area as obviously no-one was checking to refill the water or clean up. Similarly in the dining area for breakfast, the staff were not particularly attentive. Our table had no milk on for our coffees and when I pointed this out to a staff member he just moodily placed one in front of me. The dining area itself is incredibly tight, with very little space between each table. I felt like we were dining with a group of other people as they were so close together! Simple things like tables spread out more and tablecloths on the tables would have made the place much nicer. I also thought the room was a let down to what was pictured prior to booking - just a plain white bedsheet hastily made, no bed runner on which I thought made the rooms look appealing in the pictures. We had told them of our anniversary prior to our stay and we did have someone come to our room with a card and gift, which was a nice gesture. However the card was just addressed to myself (not the both of us - then saying Happy Anniversary - which obviously means two people are involved) and handed us one little bag with fudge in and one drinks voucher. Gave me another fudge bag when saw 2 of us. Considering it's obviously for an anniversary it would be common sense to provide two drinks vouchers so that as a couple we could enjoy our drink together.

I also thought the room was a let down to what was pictured prior to booking - just a plain white bedsheet hastily made, no bed runner on which I thought made the rooms look appealing in the pictures. We had told them of our anniversary prior to our stay and we did have someone come to our room with a card and gift, which was a nice gesture. However the card was just addressed to myself (not the both of us - then saying Happy Anniversary - which obviously means two people are involved) and handed us one little bag with fudge in and one drinks voucher. Gave me another fudge bag when saw 2 of us. Considering it's obviously for an anniversary it would be common sense to provide two drinks vouchers so that as a couple we could enjoy our drink together. As a manager previously, I thought this just showed little thought in the actual gesture itself as there is no point providing one gesture when the celebration is obviously for two people. Overall I thought the hotel let itself down and didn't meet my expectations, which for an anniversary celebration, is sad.",6.2,"Didn't meet standards - room a disappointment, moody staff and cramped dining area.",0,bed
United Kingdom,Standard Room,1,October 2018,Couple," We booked this hotel stay to celebrate a milestone wedding anniversary. When using the pool/sauna facilities, the staff were rather ignorant and unhelpful when I pointed out that there was no water available and that there were piles of empty cups left around. This made me question the cleanliness of the area as obviously no-one was checking to refill the water or clean up. Similarly in the dining area for breakfast, the staff were not particularly attentive. Our table had no milk on for our coffees and when I pointed this out to a staff member he just moodily placed one in front of me.

United Kingdom,Royal Mile Suite,1,October 2018,Couple," After checking in at approximately 3pm, we left our room for some shopping. Upon our return it became obvious that someone had been in our room as there were some minor changes to the suite. Bedsheets had been adjusted and all of the curtains had been drawn, this wouldn’t prove to be an issue however when you know you are in possession of a number of valuables I didn’t appreciate this. 
Further to this, and more annoyingly, at approximately 12am the fire alarm began to ring out, we very quickly left the room to discover a minor state of panic amongst other guests. Of course as a health and safety procedure this wouldn’t be an issue, but what was a concern was the fact that there was no sign of any staff members in order to better organise the panic of the situation. We headed outside only to be ushered round the corner by a staff member on a cigarette break. There was no attempt to head count/ensure that everyone was evacuated and then later accounted for upon returning into the building. There was a considerate lack of communication regarding what had caused the alarm, and what the resolution had been. This is concerning given the presence of two fire engines.
The following morning we received a knock on the door to fill up the mini bar for the next guests, despite us requesting a late check out. At this point we were still getting ready for the day. 
Lastly, the light on the side of the wardrobe (above the kettle) was flickering throughout the night despite being switched off which prevented a good nights sleep.",5.8,Didn’t meet expectations,0,staff
