The rooms were very clean, had effective heating controls, and of a good size for central London at the price point! We deliberately picked larger rooms in the back newer section of the hotel, they are larger and quieter being away from the main road. The staff were also very good, we had a problem with one room (the mattress had failed so wasn't comfortable) but we were quickly and efficiently upgraded to a larger room nearby which was lovely! Both rooms had excellent showers (one with a bath) and although furniture was simple it was all in good order.

Singapore,Standard Double or Twin Room,2,January 2020,Group," Enjoyed my stay at Radisson Blu for its location, ambience, comfortable and clean room with modern clean bathroom, and superb breakfast. 
I would like to commend the staff Kayla for so kindly changing my room to one that has stairs-free access. Prior to my arrival, I chose my room on the hotel website and did not realise that there is a short flight of steps in that section. Thanks to Kayla's thoughtfulness, I was spared the trouble and hassle as we had two big luggage. In addition, she made an extra effort to check if the room was ready. I was very glad I decided to approach her to check on our room for the second time. 
Her colleague , Mr Cheok, who had checked us in 10 minutes earlier , on the other hand simply told us that the room was not ready and we could leave luggage here and return at 3 pm. He did not take the initiative to do more than necessary. Neither did he advise that the room I had booked had to be accessed via some steps.

The hotel made contact with me shortly after booking & ahead of arrival to ask about our arrival time & if we had any other requests. Check in was smooth, we enquired about dinner in the restaurant & the front desk clerk made us a reservation. 
When we arrived at the restaurant I was wished Happy Birthday. We had a lovely meal in the Steak & Lobster restaurant & the staff gave us a Happy Birthday dessert with candle at the end. A very nice touch, Thank You. We had a nightcap at the bar after dinner.
Having sweets in reception is a nice touch. The hotel in general was very clean. The rooms were comfortable & also very clean. The room had a kettle, ironing board, extra pillows in the closet. Complimentary water in the fridge. 
There were security doormen on the door when we arrived which is handy if you have a heavy suitcase. Location is good right next to Warren Street Tube & a short walk to Goodge Street tube. There is a Tesco virtually next door & a Sainsbury’s over the road. There are heaps of pubs & restaurants nearby too. So you are not short of places to eat & drink.
We were staying in London as we were going to The Palladium Theatre. This was a casual 25-30minute walk along Tottenham Court Rd & Oxford Street from the hotel. Ideal location for a shopping break trip.
On the morning of check out we received a text with a link so that we could pay our bill online to speed up the check out process.

Macau,Standard Double or Twin Room,1,October 2019,Family," We spent a night here at the end of our one-week-trip to England and Scotland to celebrate my daughter’s 26th birthday. The check-in was extremely pleasant as the young lady completing the procedure was very successful in connecting to us on a personal level while maintaining impeccable professionalism. We chatted a bit and briefly mentioned the purpose of our trip thinking nothing of it. By the time we arrived to our room, however, the staff had already delivered a cold bottle of champagne and a happy birthday card for my daughter. Such a lovely surprise! Later on, we were treated to scrumptious chocolate cake. A wonderful way to make us feel very special! The room was perfect in every respect: perfectly clean, quiet, twin beds as we had requested, very comfortable mattresses and pillows. It was the perfect ending to a perfect trip, and a most restful stop before our long journeys back to the States for my daughter, and Hong Kong for me. The hotel is located in the heart of the city and we found it very convenient for meeting friends that night and doing a bit of pub hopping.

At the same time, the heater was not working, and the room was too cold. We were wearing our wool thick sweaters. 
We finally called the reception, and they sent a guy who was not helpful at all and very disrespectful. To the point that he brought a radiator, and we told him that that was not going to be enough as the radiator was too small and the room was big. We then asked for extra blankets because we were freezing. He told us that he could only give us one as the cleaning staff were going to complain (like that was my problem). He was more concerned about us getting people inside the room than to solve the real problem. He told us that he already fixed the heat (which he didn't) but that we were not going to need the blankets. I told him that we were going to decide if it was warm enough for us, not him. We were freezing. Told him that he could stay outside to check if someone else got inside our room the whole night, which it was ridiculous but we just wanted to sleep and not get sick, which we ended up catching a cold. 
Asking for blankets was like asking for extra nights or money in return. Completely absurd and ridiculous.

Unfortunately, our room was not clean. There were sweets/candy clearly visible on the carpet, left by the previous occupant (which makes your wonder how clean the rest of the room was) and the bathroom smelt badly of what I will only describe as 'sewerage'.
We were tired, so decided to close the bathroom door and address the issues at Check-Out (which was a mistake).

Australia,Standard Double or Twin Room,3,September 2019,Couple," The room was terrible.  It was badly designed and very difficult to stay in.  The bathroom was not only badly designed but dangerous to use.  The bath was too high and almost impossible to get in and out of for a shower.  There were inexplicably several completely unnecessary steps along the corridor which were difficult to manoveur a suitcase over and no staff to help bring up bags or take you to your room. 
The check in staff member wrote our room number so badly in our key folder that we went to the wrong room and had to go all the way back down to reception to get clarification for the room number. 
In the room the television didn't work properly and therr was no information about how to use the facilities.  I had to guess how to call housekeeping cause although there was a card next to the phone there was no number on it. 
The room was designed so there was only one major blinding overhead light - no lamps or reading lights - so when one of us wanted to sleep the other had to sit in complete darkness. 
Add to that even in the day we had to have the blinds drawn because the windows looked out on a filthy alley with several drunkards leering up at the windows so we were always gloomy or over lit.   
There was no attempt to soundproof the windows and we were kept up most of the night by the constant loudspeaker from Warren street station announcing it was closed or closing or evacuating..  Plus all the police and ambulance sirens.  
It was all small irritations but considering how expensive this hotel was it all added up to a very poor stay.  
When we checked out no one even asked us how our stay was or if everything was OK..  Cause honestly they clearly didn't care.",4.2,Really disappointing,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Germany,Superior Single Room,2,February 2019,Solo traveler," The hotel met many critria to be unpleasant for me as guest.
Normally, hotel interests dominated the interests of the guest.
Several 'never saw this before' situations.
A FEW aspects:
1. ROOM:
I paid more for the Radisson hotel room, assuming to get better / bigger room. This expectation met not the reality.
- The room was small and dirty, esp. bathroom and shower (see selected photos).
- Equipment was from the 90ies. Ventilation/heating system was loud.
Especially tele-dialog of the TV-set was time consuming and simply directed you to pay tv.
- Furniture: No space for using a chair at the desk. The furniture structure suggested to seat at the bed for using the desk.
Since desk and bed were located far from one to another, the desk was no place to stay longer...
2. COSTOMER SERVICE approach:
Generally, communication, structures and processes mostly focused on the interests of the hotel.
Most of the staff does the job and is not further interested in the guest. Aspects:
- Check in: unfriendly, incompetent 'machinary' first-contact communication (where was the ""welome"" which was meant?!)
- Requesting a feedback questionnaire on the quality, the reception was unable to find any or to present an alternative or relevant reaction (I did not want to waste more time in inconvenient discussion of a whole list of shortcomings, which most probably would lead to nothing...)
- Breakfast is served 7.30 (Why this late? Losing  time due to the time schedules of the hotel?). I came 7.20 and was not allowed to take seat (never experienced to be rejected this way). They really served nothing special (compare to other hotels), so that there is no argument for this very late opening of breakfast and rejecting early guests.
- The indications within the house sometimes missed to provide orientation (lift => no indication which level the restaurant is, etc.).
!!! NO reaction of Radisson at all to my feedback (via website)!!!",2.9,Dont stay there if you can get another hotel room in London (loved Radisson hotels before...),0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1
United Kingdom,Standard Double or Twin Room,1,February 2019,Couple," We got a pretty good price on this hotel, for central London at least. We have stayed in Radisson Blu hotels around the world and have always found the brand to be stylish and comfortable, and the pictures on the website indicated that this would be the same this time. It was my wife's birthday and I had cheekily asked if a complimentary room upgrade might be possible and the guest relations manager duly communicated with me and provided an upgrade. When we arrived I was told that we had been upgraded to a superior double and when we got to the room I felt that the room itself was a little disappointing. The staff were lovely, they had provided a birthday card and a delicious dessert for my wife, and I can genuinely not fault the efforts they made for me. The bed was certainly big and comfortable. The whole room though had a dated feel to it, the bathroom was a little plain, clean, but plain. The television had access to only the basic 5 television channels, which we found surprising and when my wife injured her foot during the day, and we needed to spend the night in our bedroom, it meant we did not have a great selection for viewing. The room service menu was not the best I have seen. The staff however did provide plates and cutlery for us and we had a takeaway delivered. I know anyone reading this may be thinking ""first world problems"" and what a moaning bugger, and I know that these are tiny issues. I would however say that the pictures shown of the bedrooms may not be representative of all the rooms,and if you had paid full price then I am not sure that the room we were in would have represented value for money.
