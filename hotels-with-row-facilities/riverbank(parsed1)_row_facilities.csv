United Kingdom,Executive Double Room - River View,3,October 2020,Couple," The staff memeber whom we checked in with whose name was Khaldoon was brilliant. So helpful, friendly and informative. The room which had been upgraded for us by the hotel was exceptional. We stayed in a one bedroom king suite with the view of the Big Ben, River Thames and London Eye. The view was so beautiful at night. Opted in for a few upgrades as it was my partners birthday so went for prosecco on arrival, and the 'celebration package' which included more prosecco in an ice bucket, balloons which were blown up around lounge area and a hand-made cake. Breakfast each morning was hosted in the hotel restaurant and was a english breakfast buffet-style.

We ve given you a room upgrade” this was a lie as we had booked the room which we were given.
The facilities were great. However they do not mention that if you want to use the pool you have to book a time slot, this very nearly caused a melt down for my Autistic Daughter. Thankfully they let us in. If you need to book, tell us!!

Gym was enough to maintain fitness away from home during a short stay.  Location was excellent.  By far and away, the best thing about Park Plaza is the staff.  Travelled with my elderly mother and the staff took exceptional care of her.  Special mention to Ken who looked after us at breakfast and even looked out for us on the second morning so that he could give my mum the lovely table by the window in his section. That man should get some kind of hospitality award - a consummate professional and just a genuinely nice guy who made my mum feel special.  Also Abdullah - he asked us if we needed a late checkout and arranged the extra hour we asked for whilst we ate breakfast.

So Plaza On River is another hotel within the same building of the Park Plaza Riverbank and shares most of the same facilities.  The rooms however are more classic with a warmer feeling to them and they obviously focus on BEAUTIFUL river views. 
We had also been granted executive access with complementary food and drink (including alcohol from 6pm-8pm), a lovely peaceful lounge bar with stunning views of Houses Of Parliament, London Eye and many more landmarks.

The staff were dismissive and we went in at different times of the day and night. There was never any hot or cold canapés. When we asked the member of staff he was quite rude. Also I had to pay a £100 payment for access to the fridge/mini bar in my room. We didn’t use the mini bar and was advised on checking out, that I would receive a refund in 10 days. The member of staff said you should have been told. If you use a credit card it doesn’t get charged to your account. I paid by debit card. I thought that was extremely poor.

United Kingdom,Superior Twin Room,2,December 2018,Solo traveler," Part of the Park Plaza chain of hotels, which all have a similar polished feel with door staff at the entrance. I always try to book a Park Plaza hotel if my budget allows and usually you can get a decent price at either the Riverbank, Waterloo or Westminster Bridge. Although out of the three, I prefer Riverbank, since Waterloo backs onto the train line and Westminster can be very busy, especially at check-in. The rooms are nicely appointed, modern and very clean, check in staff are always friendly and they have a decent gym, pool and room service. I haven't had breakfast here and I imagine it's similar to the other Park Plaza hotels nearby which usually have a good selection of choices. It's also a nice walk along the Thames to my office near Blackfriars which takes about 25mins and also really close to HoP, Westminster Abbey, London Eye etc... all within 20min walk away if you're sight seeing.

As a result of this I decided to order breakfast to my room on the second morning and duly filled out my breakfast card and left on my door handle the previous evening to be collected.

United Kingdom,Suite - River View,2,December 2018,Couple," This was the second time I've stayed here,I booked it months ago and paid a lot of money for a suite as high as possible and a river view!
I ended getting a river view in the lounge area of my suite but not the bedroom area which is the main point of our visit, also I paid to have breakfast in the executive lounge and each day I went for breakfast they tried to tell me I was in the wrong place and should be on the 1st floor,even after ai explained I had payed for the privilege!!!
They then humiliated me in front of other guests making me wait there until they had confirmed this with reception as if I was telling lies!!!!!
I have booked a return visit for two nights at the end of March and will be expecting a better room and better treatment. I have booked to stay in the plaza on the river and look forward to your reply.

Switzerland,Superior Double Room,2,November 2018,Solo traveler," Not much.
We changed rooms 3 times as the first 2 were in the middle of a renovation and there were tools on the floor in the corridor and the whole etage smelt of paint.
The second 2 rooms on the 8th floor, one had water drippjng through the ceiling and smelt of smoke, in the other there was something wrong with the air conditioning and the room was like a sauna. We complained to the manager who was very nice and actually upgraded us, but it was still very time consuming.
The drinks in the bar were exorbitant, 11 pounds for a small aperol spritz, no crisps or nuts either. You couldn't get a coffee in the bar before 11 oclock if you were not having breakfast which was both ridiculous and very annoying as because  the hotel isn't very central we had to walk for about 30 minutes to find somewhere.
Then to top it all on the second night of our stay the fire alarm went off at 22.45, which was extreemly frightening as we were on the 14th floor.When we arrived outside in bare feet and dressinggowns we were told by a guy smoking outside the hotel that it was a false alarm...... no one from reception apologised or gave us any explanation which we found atrocious, we returned to our rooms rather worried and as you can imagine we didn't sleep very well.
We were all really disappointed with lots of things, the reception gave us no information of where anything was when we checked in, so I think they definitely need some training in customer relations.
Most of the staff didn't acknowlege you in the corridors which isn't very  good either.

After a debate about child safety and a mattress we left for a few hours. The manager promised to resolve it prior to us coming back and to phone. No phone call! We got back to the room and the travel cot had been lined with towels by head of house keeping! Apparently no mattresses are provided and no one has ever complained before. It took till 7pm to have to move rooms and I had to sleep with the baby in the bed and ensure he did not fall out! They did give us complementary room service but I would have preferred a safe place for my baby to sleep! Cleanliness in rooms was not great either.

Reported this to reception who said they would deal with this and visited the room and said the bed could not be fixed. They changed the room and promised a cot as we had dinner arrangements. When we arrived back to the Hotel around 7.30 as my grandson is only 1 they went back to the room to find there was no cot? My son came back to reception to repot this again they said they would get this sorted. After 20 minutes still no cot had arrived. So I asked at reception as it was past my grandsons bed time. They said they wound speak with housekeeping. I did comment that this was the third time we had asked about a cot also it had been pre arranged. They said they would get straight onto it.

Last but not least, the tables in the resturants were always felthy and had a bad smell, that was clear to me after I saw how the staff cleans it, a resturant staff member took a dry napcin, spreaded some water on it and draged it on the table with the food leftovers just once and that was it, there were food ubder a few tables that just stood there all the time, that was really bad.",7.1,Good,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Qatar,Executive Double Room - River View,6,January 2020,Family," Park Plaza is a very comfortable and well located hotel to stay in.This was my 4th stay. Their room service staff is polite, professional and very efficient BUT, the Housekeeping Department is not at all at par with the rest of the hotel. I had to ask the people concerned in the lobby EVERYDAY to make sure my room was cleaned as it wasn't done on the 2nd day. Moreover even though I requested a change of sheets on my 4th day, all they did was change 2 of the pillow covers and duvet cover. The bed sheet, which needs to be changed more often was not!!
I stayed there for 6 days but my bedsheet wasn't changed! Even after speaking to people at the desk.
It was futile calling housekeeping and get into an arguement with someone there (and I spoke to them quite a few times to ask again and again for face towels and for laundry etc), as almost everyone I spoke to in Housekeeping didn't seem to understand English or in fact even spoke it clearly.

Told would take 10mn so waited an hour. It had not been done. So had to go back to reception from 15th floor & they got house keeping onto it. So we were then in the room & had already shifted table & chairs to make room for twin bed to be shifted to the right. There was only one packet of biscuits in the room & one bottle of water for 2 people. So I asked for 3 bottles & 3 biscuits to make up for lack of these & for inconvenience that bed still not done after an hour! Also told the view we had in the upgrade was lovely but it was of the hotel opposite, you could nearly see into the room. The view doesn’t bother me, except when someone tells you that you have a city view & you can’t see the city unless you went to the very edge of the window on right & leaned.

United Kingdom,Suite - River View,1,December 2019,Family," We should have been able to book into our two rooms from 2pm. This was an 80th birthday present for my Dad. We arrived at 3.30pm to a long queue and were then causally informed the room with a river view wouldn’t be ready for a ‘long time’ due to previous guests leaving late. We were told to come back in an hour which is completely unacceptable. Came back after about 40 mins and complained to another receptionist who unfortunately didn’t appear to have a full grasp of English - we seemed to be at cross purposes. I emphasised that there wasn’t going to be a lot of point in booking a room with a view if it was dark by the time we got it, but she just kept reassuring me we would get a room with a view! I offered to clean the room myself as I really wanted my Dad to see the view in daylight. Eventually Mark came to the rescue. He took charge of the situation, and discovered the room we were supposed to have hadn’t even begun to be cleaned. He then moved heaven and earth to get us transferred to the sister half of the hotel and upgraded us to a much better suite and view of the river with the Houses of Parliament. He definitely saved the day and for us the reputation of the hotel. But it had taken an hour and 40 minutes for us to get my Dad into his room, so we weren’t able to fit in a pre-theatre meal.
The only other downsides were no one answered the phone when I had a query late at night - and the next morning the phone kept ringing but there was no one there when I answered it. You have to get all the information about breakfast times/location and the pool from the TV channel - a paper guide would be good, especially for older guests. Breakfast was great for us but by the time we left at 9.10am there was a massive queue - so best to go early.",8.3,Poor first impressions but improved,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I went down from the 16th floor and spoke to reception. She questioned ms at first as she really thought there was a sofabed in our room. She asked if we had pland and yes we did, it was my birthday. She said to get ready in the room we were in and she would sort another room. Concierge would move our bags later. Before we left the room was ready. When we returned back to the hotel that evening with two very tried children, the sofa bed wasn't even made. We had to call guest servives/reception again to ask someone to do it.

We returned to our table and waited and waited for the eggs but they never arrived. After reminding staff at least  3 times, the breakfasts had gone cold, so we are asked if we could have them reheated, the gentleman took them away to reheat, and then after bringing our plates back minus the fried eggs we were told the eggs would be a couple of minutes, so again we waited, guess what no eggs. by this time breakfast was cold again before staff brought our eggs. We couldn't eat the food by now, so did complain to a male member of staff who said he would speak to the manager. We were offered to choose something from the a la Carter menu, which would be free of charge, but there was nothing on this menu that remotely came close to an English breakfast.

New Zealand,Superior Double Room,5,October 2018,Solo traveler," With the exception of the staff in the bar/restaurant and the cleaning lady, the staff were generally unfriendly, unhelpful and had little sense of customer care. There were a series of problems during my stay - for instance being locked out of my room with all my luggage and possessions in it - with the hotel denying I had ever been in that room and insisting I had been in a different room 5 floors higher. When this was eventually sorted out, there was no apology nor any explanation given. Until the point they found I was actually telling the truth, it was as though I was making the matter up to inconvenience them. Some serious training in customer care and service is required. Over the weekend, an event in the hotel - possibly a wedding or christening - descended into violence and chaos that spilled over into the lobby and the immediate outdoor surrounds to the hotel. Lots of police appeared, lots of security staff appeared and after a brief period when it all felt a little unsafe, things settled.

It took up too much room, particularly as it was not requested at booking. Second, coming to London for a one night stay it would have been nice to have a room with a view. However, as this was a gift from a sister in law who organised an event, we believe it met all other aspects and requirements.

Ireland,Executive Double Room - River View,2,August 2018,Couple," Working for years in hospitality, regretfully I must say that our trip was not was I would expect from a 4 star hotel.
It was a special occasion and I requested prior check in what I consider a fair and simple request: to leave a note in the bedroom upon arrival and a room with bath. What is my surprise when at check in, there is no notification received even thought the several emails sent (via booking.com and directly to the property). This said, I would like to personally thank Monica (I believe this was her name if I remember correctly), as she was extremely nice and professional, and she reassured that at least we got the room with the bath. Due to the lack of preparation of my two requests (and even though I really appreciated her work, the room was not cleaned upon arrival and there was dust all over the furniture - not a severe case, but I am allergic to dust & thankfully this was more or less solved the morning after). We received later on some macaroons in the room, I believe thanks to Monica too - Italian speaker - great attention to detail.
I must say that we also got a room in a floor where some maintenance work was getting done, therefore we could find dust, paint, and dirtiness all over the hall, and experienced some maintenance noises during early hours of the morning.
The room did not have a proper table for having breakfast (one chair on a working desk and one sofa with a bed table), which is a shame, taking into consideration the wonderful views and the potential guest experience, so it was not really comfortable or nice to use and pay for the room service (plus, I would like to mention that I personally find ridiculous to charge 21 pounds for a breakfast that is consisted in literally 6 pieces of food - it is weird to provide with a full selection of marmalade but no bread or bun or whatever to spread it...).",7.1,Good,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In the river view room there was no English plug sockets by the beds for phone charging and the lighting was extremely dark, even with all the curtains drawn. The Bed was ok... not the standard expecting. 
On arrival we informed the staff that the riverbank has been closed for sometime so they should take it off booking.com. It is incredibly misleading to offer a hotel when it’s closed. Completely unacceptable. 
On check out, the staff let a lady push in front of us even though we had been waiting for 10 minutes patiently. Then on complaint they said ‘oh you should just put your key in the bowl...’ no sign to say to do so...
£150 deposit taken for hotel which is in the ‘terms and conditions’... this should be sent in a clear communication beforehand. 
Parking a complete mess outside, difficult to negotiate walking around them.
Single use plastics still be used - this hotel is definitely in need of a makeover and better management.

United Kingdom,Executive Double Room,1,January 2020,Solo traveler, When I arrived at 9pm there were no double rooms available. When I complained I was offered a room but when I arrived it was clearly a sofa bed and not a full bed. The room I stayed in was on the 13th floor and the the windows overlooked the hotel air handling vents. This room was very noisy and I had great difficulty sleeping through the constant loud hum of the vents.

At checkout there was another mix up the following day which made us late.

United Kingdom,Superior Twin Room,1,January 2020,Couple," The bathroom wasn’t very clean it had some clumps of dust and hair that had been left on the floor. Just my preference but I like to see something out of a window rather than a similar building about 15 foot away, there was no chance of booking a preferred room and if necessary paying extra for it. We paid for the superior room to incorporate breakfast for an extra £25 as opposed to £22.50 each if you paid separately at the hotel, we found the breakfast awful!!! The bacon was congealed together and tasted very strange? There was also some insipid sausage along with some bland scrambled eggs, the hash brown was nice but the beans tasted of an inferior nature to a ‘standard’ type. There were only plates at the warm buffet so after queueing at the continental section, because the cooked breakfast was inedible, we had to go round again after fetching a plate because they didn’t have any there. We had to wait for ten minutes for one of the rare waiters to fetch a small jug to put milk in for our tea and coffee, when we did get some the coffee was like sludge and not very nice so went for the machine version and dutifully queued with 6 other guests for one o the machines whilst a similar number queued for the other machine, getting down the last two we were then told the machine had stopped working so had to join the back of the other queue!!! I decided to have a latte and a cappuccino but upon returning couldn’t taste any difference between the two as they were both really poor. My advice would be to not bother with breakfast as it was really bust and definitely not worth the wait, go out and find somewhere else. My last moan is we were unceremoniously woken at 03:45 in the morning by someone trying to get into the room opposite by tapping, banging, slapping and shouting to the occupant all to no avail, in the end I had to tell him to go down to reception to get them to attract the attention of whoever he was cohabiting with.

He said to me “you had Disney cases, they were taken back to concierge!” Julian the housekeeping manager heard all this and then took us back down to reception where another concierge man found our bags and said the guest in our room didn’t see our bags but he clearly had cos the guest told me I had Disney bags so he’d seen them! And we had valuables in the bags which if he wasn’t an honest person he could have taken our belongings including an iPad!

I paid for a suite and received a glorified hall way that could just about fit a bed in... We were sold this as an upgrade from the room I had booked.
I included breakfast in the booking... On the first day this breakfast was an hour late, cutting into our day. When I called down to see why it was an hour late and where it was the staff member was combative as if we had somehow done something wrong to make the breakfast late.
I instructed her that it would be good manners to apologise rather than try and blame us for their obvious failings and she all of a sudden found her customer service hat again and went and sorted it.
When it arrived it was cold and it got even colder as they sent it up to us without any forks which isn't ideal for tackling scrambled eggs and beans.
When I called down for the forks I mentioned it would be rather cheeky of them for that breakfast to remain on the bill nonetheless it did, they obviously see that as satisfactory service.
This was room 1542, if they offer you this room in the guise of a ""suite"" do not accept it. It's a very narrow odd shaped room and the only decent thing about it is the terrace and the view which at night is brilliant.
Check in and check out both bang average.... I had no photo id on me at check in and so the guy made a big deal of it and basically tried to make out he was doing me a favour letting me stay there for the £450 I was paying for 2 nights.
On check out we weren't even asked how our stay was which is just as well really because I'd probably still be there now.
We were up on the top floor, with the room being so small and narrow we were obviously going to want to enjoy the terrace.... To do this you have to drag yourself down 15 floors again to fill out a form and get a key....

When I arrived they wanted to see photo ID (I'd stayed the week before, wasn't asked for then, I even have their loyalty card) which they then took away and copied (I presume).  I asked why - ""It's our policy for all booking.com customers"". I also said I wanted a receipt on departure. ""We can't give you one because you booked through booking.com"". I'd had the same problem last week and in the end emailed booking.com, who emailed Park Plaza, who emailed me a receipt.  What a waste of eveveryone's time!  So I persisted (""It's not our policy"") and said I had eventually got one from the previous week (""Well that's not how I've been trained"").  The Asst Manager came out.... ""It's not our policy, we can't do it because the rate you pay is different from our agreed price with booking.com"".  So I showed him last week's invoice - which showed exactly the same amount!  He grudgingly agreed they would provide one on departure (which they did).  Later I went to the bar to get something to eat.  The Maitre d' greeted me and told me to sit anywhere.  The one free table (for 2) was in the window, set for food, so I sat down.  Within 30 seconds he was back telling me I couldn't sit there, that was for the restaurant menu, I'd have to sit at the bar.  So I moved to the bar and he brought me the bar menu.  Then ignored me.  As did the other waiting staff.  I eventually spoke to a passing waitress..... ""I'll get one of the bar staff to take your order"".  Nothing.  Eventually after nearly half an hour I decided there were more deserving places to spend my money so I went to the burger bar under the railway arches down the road where the service was a million times better than this so-called 4-star hotel.

We spent a good 3 mins trying to find the room. During this time we asked for directions to our room from the housekeeping personnel that were around. The first 2 spoke zero english, she kept talking to us in spanish i believe. Finally a male member of staff was able to assist, pointing us in the right direction. Upon entering our room, we noticed that bathroom had not been cleaned. Towels & toiletries were changed , however there were multiple stains on the floor and the wall just by the toilet (looked like piss). The carpet was not hoovered (bits of food) and the hard floor had foot prints and dirty marks. We called reception and was told someone would come up. The lady who came up told us that the ?pee (stains) could not be cleaned, she did not acknowledge the dirty carpet & hard floor despite us pointing it out, she was incredibly rude and not at all professional. We went downstairs to complain, only to be told that house keeping would clean the room in an hour or 2. We asked for a room change which fortunately they agreed to. Suffice to say it was evident that the cleanliness and attention to detail was incredibly lacking for this hotel coz the 2nd room was clearly not well cleaned either (although the bathroom was better, no pee stains). Day 2 of our stay, we woke up to a cold room with the ac blowing cold air despite being set at the max of 28C. I rang reception and an engineer came up. He fiddled with the ac for about 30mins following which he said if it doesnt get warm in 10mins then it would be a ""big job"". Reception rang after to check if the issue had been resolved and after a long chat it was decided that we would be given a heater. 2 hrs later, housekeeping brought us a kettle😣!

their 40th wedding anniversary. I gave you special instructions of this
special occasion and they did have a note. I also called the hotel prior
to their stay and they advised something would be complementary. Your
website advised that a small deposit would guarantee the booking. 2 days
after booking, they took the whole amount. I manually updated the
details to my mum and dads name as advised by yourselves. When I called
the hotel they wanted another full payment from myself and this would be
refunded back to me within 5-10 working days. I have an email as proof.
They put them on the 13th floor with a view of the building. I am very
disappointed with the service and the complementary surprise. There was
no hair dryer in the room, which I find very strange, even the most
basic hotels have these facilities. They got the bill at the end of
their stay, which had £145.00 added for using the mini bar. They never
took anything from the mini bar. This was a clerical error. For being a
very favourable hotel, there was no bathrobes or slippers either. I have
my husbands mum and dad going this weekend. I'm not looking forward
to their feedback after their stay. I would not recommend this sister
hotel to anyone. Cheaper priced other Park Plaza hotels are much loved
and have everything you require for a memorable special occasion. I

Kuwait,Deluxe King Room with River View,3,March 2019,Couple," My partner did upgrade for the suite through phone because it was my birthday as a surprise after I booked in booking but when we arrived there they had no idea about it so it was poor communication and system also my partner paid for VIP reservation service so we can do early check-in and do special treatment for us and good services but unfortunately they didn't let us in early check in and we waited from 10 am till 2:30 pm ! Also the staff were too rude to us and they don't smile at all
the cleanliness was terrible they didn't clean for 3 days the suite ! they cleaned the toilet only but and rest of the suite was a mess and dirty and the bed sheets was the same for the whole stay it was dirty and they didn't changed it too nasty and the cake we ate and the finished bottle and glasses of wine they didn't pick it up for 3 days was there and they didn't clean the living room it was messy and dirty
also they charged us on meals and drinks that we haven't order !! and then they found out that there was someone took our name and orders food on our room number and our name so it's means there was breach of information between staff other wise how come someone random oder food and drinks on our NAME AND ROOM NUMBER how he knew that secret information if it wasn't breach from the system or staff and how come they have poor security that they allowed random person to order food on our name without checking if he was real guest or a thief  !!!! so the security there was terrible
also the second day they stole my adopter I left it in the bed and came back I couldn't find it.we told them and instead of apologizing or giving us a new one and checking with the room service to investigate they were too rude to us and told us to do police report if we want !",3.8,it was terrible experience I would never ever come back to this hotel again !,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

United Kingdom,Executive Double Room,4,February 2019,Couple," On arrival we had a stain on a duvet in our room on the 15th floor, so got moved. The room we were moved (also on 15th floor) to had marks all over the walls and floor in the bathroom as if it had never been wiped or cleaned, along with a brown ""smear"" above the toilet roll holder. The concierge simply advised us to put some water on the shower wall and see if it improved. This caused a bad smell. I tried closing the shower down and it jammed. The next day we were moved to another room, which seemed fine. We later noticed a hole in the bedding, hairs under the pillow, a broken toilet seat and all the pillows were rock hard. Upon pointing this out to the so called Guest relations manager they wrote the issues down, and wrote ""NBTD"" at the bottom, (nothing better to do).........I returned to reception with another request, only to overhear them slagging us off and insinuating we were ""playing them"" and ""playing games"" and ""after something""........""he wants something from us"" etc etc. I then speak to the management the next day, and specifically asked for the General manager and received fob off, after fob off after fob off. A staff member also described us as ""very difficult"" right under our noses to other guests, however he did so in French, unluckily for him I speak the language, and when I challenged him he claimed they were speaking about football.........We were told General manager would be available at 3pm, we say we will be back by 3pm to speak to him, when we ask for him, the front of house manager tries to suggest we said 5pm not 3pm......I then go down at 5pm and he isn't available.........We ended up with uncomfortable pillows, a broken toilet seat, and a generally unclean room, and staff that just kept on insulting us quite frankly.

United Kingdom,Executive Double Room - River View,3,February 2019,Solo traveler," I had arrived at the hotel at around 16:30 after a very gruelling almost 14hr long haul flight and all I wanted to do was get some sleep. Even though im a Radisson Gold card holder I had to wait for almost 20 mins to get to the check-in desk at reception only to find that the room, which was supposed to be ready to check-in to at 14:00 was not ready and was informed by the staff I would have to wait for 1 - 2 hours before the room was ready for me. At that point I was so tired that I could barely keep my eyes open and the only thing that was offered to me is the reception staff told me they would keep my luggage for me while I waited. Ive just gotten off a very long flight I was exhausted, where was I supposed to wait, was I expected to sit in a seat in the lobby or aimlessly walk round London exhausted while they prepared my room. Id booked a room with a river view and in the end I ended up having to stay in a lesser priced room with no river view and the bathroom smelled as if it hadn't been cleaned properly. The apology I received, at reception for this was hardy convincing. The following morning I discovered the the reason why the room hadn't been ready, the previous day, when I left my room for work, ensuring the ""please clean my room light was illuminated"" the cleaning staff where stood in the corridor less than four rooms away gossiping. I arrived back after being away for over three hours and the room hadn't been clean. I was still suffering from jet lag so I just went to my room so I could sleep again. I later phoned reception to ask for some fresh towels, I've now checked out of the room, three days have gone by and im still waiting for those towels. Ive stayed in the hotel numerous times and never had a problem before but I can assure you I will think very strongly about staying there again.

We were confused as to how the house keeping didn't notice this when cleaning / servicing the room? It must have been noticed as it was stuck and wouldn't even slide half way! Or maybe it was noticed but they just didn't think people would care?! Very awkward if you would go to the toilet with the door wide open if you ask me! We rung up reception about this and stated someone either needs to fix it or we will have to move rooms (as we had plans for the afternoon) we didn't want it to waste our time. 40 Minutes and 4 phone calls later - a maintenance guy finally decided to arrive! After he was unable to fix or shut the door he then had the cheek to say ""are you sure it was like this when you arrived"" VERY rude! we had literally just checked into the room, went to go toilet and couldn't shut the door! Cannot believe he tried to accuse guests like that!! We then heard him call reception and say "" I will be able to fix it but it will take quite a while"" So the reception rang us and said they will move us rooms and call us back in a few minutes time - 10 minutes later no call.. so we took matters in our own hands and went out of our way to take our luggage and go down to reception.

Also not a very personal service when you have to queue for your own tea and coffee.We therefore did not stay for breakfast.
