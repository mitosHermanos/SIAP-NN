As you walk into the hotel there was a automatic hand sanitizer machine and the Track & Trace scan before reaching the reception desk. Behind the sanitizer was a trendy bar and seating area with tables, bar stools and mood lighting but it was roped out of use until collecting breakfast which had to collected at a chosen time. Breakfast was hot and cold food served in individual containers in a grab bag but they should have at least provided a plate to eat off instead of out of the separated containers. The reception was to the left on entry and consisted of a desk oppositie the lifts. Check-in staff was friendly but I was taken by surprise when they insisted on photo ID which I don't usually walk with. Luckily I had my work ID with me as I was on-call as a keyworker. There was also another seating area to the left of the reception desk that seemed part of a café area with tall backed arm chairs and coffee tables. Next to the lift was 2 tall fridges holding alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages and chocolates plus another tall cupboard of snacks and freezer with ice-cream below a travel essentials cupboard all for sell and purchasing at reception.There was signs for the fitness centre but I didn't visit it due to the COVID restrictions.
The carpeted corridors leading to the bedrooms had strip lighing lining each wall between the doors giving it a trendy look. The bedroom was very modern with digital panels to set the lighting in room & bathroom and also set the heating, air conditioning and mood lighting. There was a lovely blue & aqua neon lighting within one side of a patterned wide and full length mirror.The king size bed had a single shelf either side of the bed with a large bed settee next to one of the bedside shelves. Opposite the bed was a long desk with a fridge as one of the drawers and a glass coffee table between the bed settee and d",8.0,Pleasant stay in a big trendy room,1,staff,0

United Kingdom,Superior King Room,1,October 2020,Couple," We have stayed at this hotel many times before and have always been happy with every aspect of our stay. I was a little anxious being away from home due to the current situation but I needn’t have worried. For me, they went above and beyond when it came to making sure we would feel safe during our stay.  
From the hand sanitiser and QR code as soon as you walk in, a camera to take your temperature, protective screens at reception, the pots for used pens and used key cards so there could be no cross contamination. Then there were the little touches in the room where there strips around the toilet and the wardrobe to show that it had been sanitised, the toilet rolls had packaging around on it so again you knew it hadn’t be used by the previous occupant. Yes there were paper cups and wood stirrers to use instead of the usual mugs and spoons but that wasn’t an issue for me. We even had the option to use a QR code to allow me to use my mobile phone as the tv remote control, which was really easy to set up and for those who didn’t want to do this, the remote control was kept clean and safe in a protective bag.  
Even when we had a takeaway delivered to the hotel, which we often do during our stays, the hotel provided takeaway boxes and plastic cutlery for us to use. The hotel was only open to residents only after 18:30 and wristbands were provided to ensure this was managed properly.

Switzerland,Superior Twin Room,5,May 2019,Family," Due to an exceptional case, we cancelled a booking for five nights at central London and luckily found Park Plaza at Park Loyal with reasonable price. It turns out to be a good choice.
From the very beginning I was a bit disappointed by the location of this hotel because it is at 3rd district in London (according to London Tube map) so it takes more time to visit city center. However, we soon got used to this distance and became comfortable because of the easy access to the tube itself. The hotel is so close to the tube station that the distance does not bother any more.
It was also disappointing when I entered into the room after check-in due to bad smell. I even wanted to quit staying here. The staff accepted my complain about the smell and tried to change the room for me. One day after I got to learn that the smell comes from the chemical cleaning stuff. The hotel has indeed a ""Go Green"" plan, for which you may even get 10 pound discount if you skip the room service per night. In order to avoid that smell, I've chosen the Go Green option. The towels got updated still every day, which is pretty enough for us.
The bed is comfortable here. Space is enough to turn around. TV is also a good set. So in overall, it's a comfortable stay in this hotel with a rather reasonble price compared to the price in central London.
On the day for an early check-out, hotel has also prepared breakfast-takeway for us. This is also nice.

Switzerland,Superior Twin Room,5,May 2019,Family," Due to an exceptional case, we cancelled a booking for five nights at central London and luckily found Park Plaza at Park Loyal with reasonable price. It turns out to be a good choice.
From the very beginning I was a bit disappointed by the location of this hotel because it is at 3rd district in London (according to London Tube map) so it takes more time to visit city center. However, we soon got used to this distance and became comfortable because of the easy access to the tube itself. The hotel is so close to the tube station that the distance does not bother any more.
It was also disappointing when I entered into the room after check-in due to bad smell. I even wanted to quit staying here. The staff accepted my complain about the smell and tried to change the room for me. One day after I got to learn that the smell comes from the chemical cleaning stuff. The hotel has indeed a ""Go Green"" plan, for which you may even get 10 pound discount if you skip the room service per night. In order to avoid that smell, I've chosen the Go Green option. The towels got updated still every day, which is pretty enough for us.
The bed is comfortable here. Space is enough to turn around. TV is also a good set. So in overall, it's a comfortable stay in this hotel with a rather reasonble price compared to the price in central London.

Turkey,Superior Twin Room,1,December 2018,Couple," Perfect place with all details. My next trips, I stay here only. Very professional and friendly staff. Rooms are big in size, comfortable, modern, well equipped with technology and clean. After other hotels, we felt like having a break to rest.  The location in my opinion, perfect.

Underground right across the road which connects directly to central London via Piccadilly line. There’s another station 10 min by walk served by central line. So it literally takes 30-35 minutes to get to Oxford circus. The staff are cordial and helpful. I was particularly impressed with the gentleman in charge of night security.

Denmark,Superior King Room,7,August 2018,Couple," My boyfriend and I both enjoyed the stay at Park Plaza. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the TV (and the sky channels!), as well as the air conditioning (which was much appreciated in this heat). The mood lighting was also a nice touch, and the room was a nice size. The bed was very big and fine to sleep on, much better than what we have experienced elsewhere in London but still far from the best nights sleep you have ever had. The location was also very convenient, and it was easy to use the tube. Even though the hotel was right next to a busy motorway the room was extremely quiet, and I felt like each room was very well isolated which was a huge plus!",7.5,"Very modern, safe and comfortable.",1,tv,0

They didn’t clean it properly until I complained including setting up bed . Free bottle of water is a normal free service at any 4-5 stars hotel but they only offered it the first day . When I asked them they said I have to pay or I should be a gold reward card holder . Later they brought a bottle saying sorry it was a trainee who didnt know the rules . No more water was offered after that ! For two mornings breakfast was short and they couldn’t serve the no of hotel guest . It felt like a miserable fame . The only people who were helpful are SUNY , Sara .",4.6,Average,1,dirty,0

Ireland,Superior King Room,5,January 2019,Couple," Service in the bar and restaurant was very poor. For a 4 star hotel it realy needs to up their game. Staff walk around like they don't care. Only seen them work when it was time to get the morning cutlery away and get the tables ready for dinner. Very very very poor service. 
After breakfast the toaster and food heaters were not removed from the restaurant. Again for a 4 star hotel this is just laziness and ignorance. I have worked in both 3 star hotel for 5 years and had a chance to work in a 5 star hotel. So I know what I'm talking about. 
Staff really need a good kick up the rear end. And the housekeeping is just on another level. We had a smart tv in our room so we decided to go into my acount on Netflix to enjoy some movies. After coming back every day for 5 days that we stayed there. We kept finding random movies and series beeing watched on my netflix account. Too which I  and I alone have the details to. So it means that housekeepers were watching tv and plus use my netflix instead of cleaning the room. Plus the room was never cleaned properly. 
Alot of restaurant staff are just walking around throwing things around and have an Attitude when talking to people. Specially one fella. Not going to mention his name but he was French I believe very heavy guy. Never had his shirt tucked in and always walking around like the guests should praise him. That's is not the attitude to have. Very disgusted by the service.",5.4,Fair,1,staff,0

United Kingdom,Superior King Room,2,December 2019,Couple," On the 2nd night we arrive back at the hotel to find the only parking spaces available were disabled ones which had traffic cones placed in front of them. As we had already paid for parking and have a disabled badge, my husband moved one so that we could park up. Almost immediately a member of staff wearing a high vis jacket came out because we had moved the cone and asked whether we had a disabled badge which we had already displayed in the car. The reason I have an issue with this is because the 5 cars in the row opposite were also parked in disabled bays yet none of those were displaying a disabled badge and neither did the 2 cars parked along side us when we left this morning. 
Almost every time we stay the disabled bays closest to the doors are coned off yet at various stages these cones are moved to allow some expensive cars to park there, again none of these have disabled badges. 
As reservations are not allowed I’m not sure why this happens but its clear there are exceptions to this rule.

United Kingdom,Superior Twin Room,3,September 2019,Family, The location isn’t great for central London but that was my own fault for not checking the distance correctly. Although it was handy enough for the Westfield shopping centre. The 95 bus right outside the hotel got us there in about 20mins - which we thoroughly enjoyed and spent a whole day there shopping and eating as there is so much variety.  Breakfast was good - a reasonable variety but the cooked breakfast definitely could be better.,7.9,Good,0,location,0

That equates to 50% of my overall stay for the 3 nights, or an extra £50 per night. How is that even acceptable? On checkout they said that any balance would be returned back but it takes 3-5 days.

There was then some confusion about what drink we could have and 10 minutes later we were served some drinks. 
Once we got to our upgraded room, it was far from the suite we were promised and a dread to think how small the normal rooms were. Later that evening we returned to the hotel and wanted a drink, however there were no bar staff, unfortunately we had to ask 3 times at reception and wait 25 minutes for a drink.

On check out the staff were very apologetic, and I did receive a credit as we barely consumed anything other then a few pieces of toast.

I was waiting, sat on the hotel corridor floor with all our bags. Whilst my husband was working with reception to get us into our room. 
Eventually we were told we had to wait for the hotel engineer to come and replace the batteries in the key card swipe pad. This was what was causing the problem. I wouldn't mind but we did check in around 10am & didnt come back to the hotel until 5pm so the hotel had all day to fix this error.

United Kingdom,Superior King Room,2,September 2018,Couple," Everything was wonderful and staff at check in were excellent.  However, the staff at breakfast let you down massively!  There were a lot of staff members clearing tables but not replacing them with cups, cutlery etc so when people came to sit down they had nothing on the table.  Also, the breakfast food items were not being monitored.  The plates ran out and staff members kept walking past but did not get any clean plates until guests complained.  Breakfast items such as scrambled egg and hash browns were not being replenished thus meaning a long line of guests were having to wait.  If you Just had a member of staff keeping an eye on a couple of things each and replenishing when low the customer experience would be so much better.  Instead of constantly having to ask for things.",7.1,"Would stay again, despite poor breakfast experience",0,staff,0

United Kingdom,Superior King Room,1,September 2018,Couple," I can honestly say that the room was to a good standard, the bed was very comfortable & met the expectations. However I did expect the level of the cleanliness to be of a higher standard, the duvet had many stains on it & this left my girlfriend feeling very uncomfortable! The stains were brownish/red. It looked like blood or something else, it made us feel like we were in a cheap bed & breakfast. In the night when we went to bed went wanted to use it but my girlfriend refused to have that on the bed & I had to agree with her. Also the counter surface where the kettle & cups were was very dirty & dusty, it was clear to see that this hadn’t been dusted or cleaned properly. It made us not even want to drink waterproof use the cups. 
We often take time for a little get away from the family, just for a night or 2. It’s mainly just for some piece & quiet but my partner wasn’t too impressed. 
I did sleep well & I hope that if we ever stay there again it’s better next time.

Denmark,Superior King Room,7,August 2018,Couple," We tried ordering room service on our third or fourth evening but we were unable to do so because of understaffing (that's all we were told). That was very disappointing because ASDA was a twenty minute walk away and it was raining heavily. We had decided on our way home to just order room service that night rather than bring something with us, so we ended up going to bed hungry. Then on our fifth day we ordered some room service for lunch, and the food was extremely disappointing, very poor quality, we waited an hour to receive it. We ordered a pizza, mac and cheese and a hamburger which all together totalled 43 pounds. The pizza was very bland, tasted like a very cheap frozen pizza. I usually like frozen pizzas, but this pizza was so bad that I barely finished half of it. They forgot to make the mac and cheese as well as bring ketchup and mayo for the hamburger, so we waited an extra 35 minutes for that to arrive, although by that time, the hamburger had already been eaten.. The hamburger looked nice but was also incredibly mediocre. The mac and cheese was fine, but felt like a canteen version of it, definitely not worth four pounds. I also think there should be two free bottles of water that are replenished each day (this is the first time I have not had access to unlimited water at a four star hotel). 
One morning we were awoken incredibly abruptly to the fire alarm, which went off extremely loudly for a full minute or two. It was extremely startling and we immediately called the reception, who couldn't answer any questions but said that someone would come up to our room and explain what had happened. No one ever came to our room as the receptionist had promised or even called us back, which we thought was a little strange. The fire alarm also went off again during the middle of the day but for less time on a different day. That wasn't a big deal to us.",7.5,"Very modern, safe and comfortable.",0,staff,0

The hamburger looked nice but was also incredibly mediocre. The mac and cheese was fine, but felt like a canteen version of it, definitely not worth four pounds. I also think there should be two free bottles of water that are replenished each day (this is the first time I have not had access to unlimited water at a four star hotel). 
One morning we were awoken incredibly abruptly to the fire alarm, which went off extremely loudly for a full minute or two. It was extremely startling and we immediately called the reception, who couldn't answer any questions but said that someone would come up to our room and explain what had happened. No one ever came to our room as the receptionist had promised or even called us back, which we thought was a little strange. The fire alarm also went off again during the middle of the day but for less time on a different day. That wasn't a big deal to us.",7.5,"Very modern, safe and comfortable.",0,dirty,0

We notified reception about this, received assurances that this would not happen the next day and that we will have ""a perfect"" breakfast tommorrow.

We spoke to Simon who was the night manager on Duty at the time and asked if we could be moved to a double room, with a toilet door and no smoke smell as per request of our payment and if not they should refund us the difference of a double room to a twin room.

Not wanting to be that customers that complains about everything, my partner and i decided to just firm it. However with the beds continuously coming apart and the smell preventing us to breathe, we were left with no choice but to complain  again in the middle of the night. We spoke to Simon who was the night manager on Duty at the time and asked if we could be moved to a double room, with a toilet door and no smoke smell as per request of our payment and if not they should refund us the difference of a double room to a twin room.

The tv had such bad signal it kept cutting out so even watching tv was disappointing.
The room service we ordered food and the chips, calamari and pizza were cold. Shocking.

The waiter was so slow at getting our drinks and menus and taking our order. When our food came the side of chips arrived half way through are meal, there was no check back. We got the pudding menus and ordered some drinks the waiter forgot about the drinks and didn’t come to take our order for another 25mins by this point we gave up, paid and left.

Saudi Arabia,Superior King Room,5,October 2019,Couple," My Ear phone was stolen in the first day of my stay. I reported this to the hotel reception and they promised me to start investigation ending within 2 days. However, nothing happened until the checkout (4 days)!! Moreover, no action was taken by hotel administration. The annoying thing is that I have to tell the story to different people every day!! The hotel manager never contacted me in this regard. I don't felt like safe for the rest of my stay (4 days) because of this annoying incident, specially that we came for shopping. Finally, Ms. Pauline Henry kindly offered me a free ride to my new hotel.

On the first visit the staff member I refered to above trying to help let me park in a disable bay so I could park only to find the people behind your desk do not know how it works and are not willing to give me to compliementary tokens because they dont know if its complimentary or charged!
2. I was given room 320 on my first visit and TV didnt work, I raised this in the morning to come to find a few days later on my next visit I am given room 320 again with the broken TV.
3. Your staff have no idea what their job is and how to do it. Another example of this is the parking payment. I was told when I checked I could pay for parking when I check out as I had cash only. Come to find in the morning the lady behind the desk says this incorrect and you have to call and pay by card but I didnt have my card!

United Kingdom,Superior King Room,2,September 2019,Couple," After arriving at the Hotel on the Friday, we got booked in, took our things to the room, went to the toilet and then went for our evening meal.  Before returning to our room we asked for some toothbrushes and were advised someone would be up with them to our room.  When we returned to out room I could hear a noise and on inspection it was the toilet which was continually flowing with water.  It wasn't flooding but it was continually following and filling and when I tried to flush the plug the toilet didn't work at all.  Spoke to staff, there was no other rooms available.  No apology was offered and no maintenance till the morning.  Had to put up with the noise all night.  Spoke to several members of staff about the issue, asked about compensation and was told they would have to check this on Monday when Senior management were back and was told someone would be in touch.

Including: one of the rooms were persistently wrong, 3rd time lucky for providing us with a super king room. Was left on hold for 10 minutes, which is just frustrating when you want to relax. 
One of our rooms was missing a door to the toilet and shower, not reasonable to give anyone a 'broken' room... Furthermore to that, in relocating rooms one of our crew left some items in that room which were never found (PJs left under pillow) ... Either the cleaners didn't go in and refresh the room, or they were thrown. Disappointing. 
I personally also cut my finger deeply on a sharp edge of the shower head fitting, didn't mention it to staff at this point, the issues were just tiring.

I requested complimentary breakfast the following morning as compensation as we had stayed up until 2am and had to go to bed hungry. The next morning we were seated in the restaurant by who I assume to be the manager, only to be approached by a waiter and informed that breakfast had closed! Not happy, so we made do with what food was left over but the glares we got from staff and being tidied around made us all feel uncomfortable. I informed the member of staff on reception when we checked out as he asked how our stay was so I told him, the same manager that seated us then came out and said “What’s the problem? You ate.”",5.4,Fair,0,restaurant,0

The bar ran out of various drinks, which I found unusual for a big hotel!
The room service menu seemed good and as we were hungry when we got back decided to order from it. The phone call to room service went unanswered as did reception. In the end I popped back down to order from the menu. However was told that as it was so busy only the margarita pizza and ham toastie was available!  As hungry I ordered one of each and was told that it would be about half an hour - this was at midnight. We eventually got our order at quarter to two! The pizza was okay but the toastie was very underwhelming- uncooked bread you couldn’t call it toast a thin piece of ham with a bit of cheese. 
Ricciardo did try and make amends when we checked out but it definitely soured our stay.",6.7,Good location,0,restaurant,0

United Kingdom,Studio Twin (3 Adults),2,June 2019,Family," Unfortunately my stay at this hotel seems less positive than the reviews I read before booking. Maybe this was due to the weekend I was there...and perhaps the biggest issue is that the staff are not trained to handle ‘busy’ weekends (influx of people due to BTS concert at Wembley Stadium).
So there were a number of issues! First off, we arrived late Friday night (11pm) - tired and just wanting to go to bed! The foyer was busy and staff looked ‘frazzled’ to say the least! No smiling welcome that I am used to at hotel reception. They had run out of key cards so security were having to escort people up to their rooms (security being all of 1 person)! We were one of the fortunate ones to get a key card - but just one...which was a right pain when my daughter and I needed to separate! Second issue - I was trapped outside the front door  - late at night on my own and felt very, very vulnerable! The automatic door is
broken from the outside so requires someone from the inside to open...which is highly problematic when your only security guard is running up and down lifts to let people into their rooms...it was a disaster! They seemed to know about the door issue but didn’t seem to be doing anything to rectify or even apologize. Staff were also completely uncommunicative - we stood waiting to be checked in for ages while the gentleman at reception stood staring at his computer...only when after much awkward silence, not knowing what was going on I asked him ‘so are you checking us in’ did he respond that he was having a system issue! Lastly - staff at the bar were unprofessional! I ordered a drink to take up to my room and handed over cash - manager of the bar then reprimands the bar lady right in front of me; saying ‘we don’t take cash after 11pm’...the poor woman looked dejected and I felt extremely awkward...that’s not the way it’s done sir!
Honestly - this was probably one of my worst hotel experiences (and I’ve stayed in many hotels)!",5.8,Can’t handle a busy weekend!! Do not recommend.,0,staff,0

United Kingdom,Superior Twin Room,1,March 2019,Group," Cleanliness could’ve been better. Didn’t realise how far from central it was and it was so unorganised we asked for connecting rooms, we checked in and they told us one room is ready the other wouldn’t be till 2 so we hung out in the one room going back down almost 2 hours later and the other room still wasn’t ready and was told we would get a room opposite and not connecting at this point we were like fine whatever just give us the second room. But they then asked us if we’re going out as the 2nd room was still not ready! We went across the road to nandos got back to the hotel at 5 and was told the room is still not ready!!!

I stay at this hotel quite regularly, at least once a month, and I always say staff are very inconsistent with customer service and on this occasion seems to be the same again.
Upon arrival as I was checking in I had a Asian, Arabic lady (she had a head scurf on) her name was SARA! She was rude not helpful kept asking for identification from me and my partner  was not helpful was rude as she was dealing with us, not once did she say thank you or please.
I asked her if there was a possibility of upgrading our room she immediately shut that down and said NO we do not have any rooms available.
Like I said I’m a regular at this hotel, but this is most definitely the last time I will be coming back to this hotel, all because of the lady at front desk (SARA) on how she dealt with me.
Would like to add every time I stay at this hotel it’s always a minimum of 3/4 nights.
So you guys have definitely lost a good customer in me.
Apart from that everything else was fine.

We've spent about two weeks in this hotel with our 3 year old kid and will share our experience.
It started when I went downstairs to the restaurant with a kid to ask to warm up chocolate for him. Tomas ,guy who work there, simply refused, he told me a lot about their ""high standards""""food hygiene """"how good they are"" but they still can't warm up a chocolate:)...
Location is good if you've got a car and don't have to go to central London, otherwise you'll spent at least 10 minutes waiting for the train in the tube and then 30-40 minutes to get to central London(believe me Piccadilly line is not quick).Hotel is about 5 minutes away from the station, but does it really helps?No
Every night they close the door after 11 P.M. But the door bell didn't work :) Funny? Not at all.It was cold and when I eventually got inside they told me ""sorry about that"" :) ""high standards""! hey didn't fix the bell until we moved out but someone was sitting there to opened the door:) High standards ?:))
From high standards point of view  the last place you you'd probably think of is under the bed, but believe me it'd be very useful to clean it there from time to time
Shower..looks good, but after you've had it the floor becomes wet in the whole bathroom and toilet, then you have to dry it:)....high standards...
Big companies likes an employees ""robot-like"" Tomas who will do everything he can to curry favor for their bosses. Simple greediness could be covered by beautiful words.",2.9,Very Poor,0,staff,0

So in other words you got the wrong room number and woke the wrong people ruining the stay for us as we didn’t get a proper full nights sleep! And all they could say was sorry about that! Also didn’t use the shower as it was filthy and obviously hadn’t been cleaned before we arrived!

So in other words you got the wrong room number and woke the wrong people ruining the stay for us as we didn’t get a proper full nights sleep! And all they could say was sorry about that! Also didn’t use the shower as it was filthy and obviously hadn’t been cleaned before we arrived! Carrying on with the bathroom total lack of privacy as the door for the toilet and shower is a sliding door that doesn’t close properly luckily I was with my daughter but if you were with a friend or colleague would be quite embarrassing as you hear everything!,5.8,Just not good enough for a supposed 4 star hotel,0,dirty,0

Of staff at the dining room area apathetic and prefers to chat with their colleagues instead of giving services. Room wasn’t clean, tolilet smells from sewage and urea. Had a lot of problems at the room first night-although we have been told it was fixed-nothing was done and we had to spent 3 hours of waiting to chang room. We got a bottle of wine from management and 50 % discount on dinner but I asked to talk to the manger and I was answered that he was gone - so didn’t have the chance to complains
