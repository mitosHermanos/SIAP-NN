It was very pale so there was obviously too much milk in it and it was sticky and heavy. It was served everyday except one, and surely the amount of scrambled egg being left uneaten on plates tells you something?? I asked for a fried egg, and that was OK, but if there was any chance of a cooked to order omlette, I didn't see the sign. There wasn't much fresh fruit, and it was mostly the same. Finally, I know coffee machines are a labour-saving device, but for the cost of the breakfast and the star rating of the hotel, It was not OK to be using a coffee machine, similar to one I saw the other day in Kwik-Fit!!

The staff are always lovely and approachable in the hotel, restaurant and in the spa area. Me and my partner did not book a table at the restaurant, and even though they were quite busy the staff done what they good to get us seat, to which we were very grateful. One of my favourite things about stay here is the comfort of the rooms, especially the beds. Warning: if you plan on staying up late to do work, stay far away from the bed because once the the blackout curtains are closed and you get slightly comfy on the bed I guarantee you will be out like a light.

United Kingdom,Premium Room with River View,1,August 2019,Family," Used the hotel as we was guests at a wedding in the hotel.
Asked to check in early as had two babies with me I was advised could check in early and to ask for the lady (Deena) when I arrived. So I arrived with a suitcase, crib, bag with bottle preps and tow babies in two to be told I could no longer check in early. And if I wanted to they could downgrade me which would cost more money but smaller bed which was a no as we had a bigger bed for a reason with 4 of us in a room.!!! Went back 4/5 times to ask about check in and was told to come back in 10/15 minutes each time! This was very stressful as they was fully aware the wedding was starting at 12 in their hotel and I had all my luggage with me plus the two babies! . Eventually the wedding started and we only got to check in exactly at the check in time! Was very unhelpful! 
The room once got in it was old and worn and smelt like it had been cleaned by a damp cloth all over!! 
Not a superior room as advertised. Nothing different to the standard room a family member was staying in. 100% wouldn’t stay here. Staff where rude and in the evening bar staff where snappy and didn’t seem like they wanted to be there!",5.8,Wouldn’t return!!,1,bed,0

United Kingdom,Superior Room with River view,1,November 2019,Couple," Upon arrival of the property, there was a strange odour within the lobby area that myself and partner both noticed and said. We stayed on the fifth floor and there was also a strong smell of paint right a long the corridor, the paint smell can’t be helped obviously and there was plenty of signs to indicate what was still wet etc, but the smell in the lobby wasn’t the best start - wasn’t unbearable but wasn’t pleasant either. Our room was okay, it seemed quite dated and was clean enough. One of our bathroom lights was broke and flicked constantly when switched on, the tube needs replaced (room 508 - floor 5). Our bed was very low to the ground, and slanted. It felt as though I was a lot higher up than my partner, but I think this reason was because it was two king beds that had been pushed together to create the double. The pillows, and quilts were both comfortable and warm though. In the morning after what was an okay sleep we went to make a coffee each, when we had a look at the tea and coffee condiments there was a handful of different teas, plenty of sugar and sweetener but only one sachet of coffee, I don’t know if this was a mistake or the normality but was a problem for us as we both enjoy a coffee in the morning, what made it worse was that we had also ordered two with our breakfasts in the morning to the room, and it turned up without any coffee, and instead just orange juice which we didn’t order. Check out was fine and again pleasant, and we are certain that if we raised the issue with a member of staff they would have been kind enough to sort our demands. It wasn’t the best stay but can’t fault the staff, I just think I have for sure stayed in better Radisson’s elsewhere in different cities than this one and they have perhaps set a higher standard than this particular establishment.",7.9,Good Facilities and Friendly Staff.,0,location,0

- unavailable spa service for walk-in or within few days in advance, which is disappointing as I booked because of available spa 
- hotel dated with modern details 
- wall cracks in the hotel lobby, damaged lift, damaged air-conditioning wall control unit
- mould in washroom

Although I read on TripAdvisor that parking would be discounted at check out this wasn't the case. NCP car park up the road opposite, probably a 5 min walk from the entrance.

Australia,Premium Room with River View,1,February 2019,Solo traveler," Nowhere at the time of booking, or in my non refundable booking confirmation email did it state that the credit card that was used for payment, would need to be presented at the time of check in.  I made this booking from Melbourne, Australia and this was a Christmas gift for my parents who live in Liverpool, England.  I noted that it would not be me who would be checking in, and gave the booking contact name and details.  When my parents attempted to check in, there were told that they had to pay for the room as they didn't have my credit card.  They were hit with a $311.61 (1 hundred and 72 pound) bill!!  My parents called me immediately and I spoke with Dinah on reception who was rude and unhelpful and passed the blame to Booking.com for not providing the hotel payment policy correct information.  I was told to call back on Monday (the booking was for a Saturday) and that I would need to speak with the hotel accounts team.  Since my booking was non refundable, even if my parents refused to stay, I would have still been charged!!  My Mum paid the $311.61 on her credit card and they continued with their planned hotel stay.  They had a really nice time, but the whole trip was tainted by the first encounter and the worry that they had to foot a very expensive hotel stay, when they only lived 40 minutes out of the city!  I called the accounts team as advised by Dinah on Monday and spoke to a really helpful lady called Natalia who apologized for the incident, processed a refund on Mums card and confirmed that the payment would be taken from my card, as originally planned.  The whole incident was very stressful and took the excitement, fun, and Christmas cheer away from the fact that this was supposed to be a Christmas present - it cut into my parents spending money and they spent the rest of the day/night being very careful with what they spent just incase the refund request was declined on the Monday when I was advised to call.",7.5,"Lovely hotel, great location, rude and unsympathetic reception staff!",0,price,0

United Kingdom,Standard Room,1,January 2019,Solo traveler," The valet service - I was told to call 30 mins before I wanted my car and it would be brought round. I did this, and was called back after 20 mins and told there was no driver to bring my car round. I would have to be walked over to their secure parking facility to retrieve my car myself.  I was a bit miffed as this was done without any apologies for the inconvenience. I mentioned it at check out and was told the maximum discount they could offer was £5.

United Kingdom,Standard Room,1,February 2020,Solo traveler," I was  giving to stay the room 313 and the major problem was bathroom - for me the bathroom should be a very cosy place where you  can relax taking a shower or a hot bathtub. Unfortunately the bathroom (toilet area and the shower) is designed for people with disabilities. There are people without any issues but there are people (like me) with different phobias and for me isn’t cool at all to use the bathroom and  being kind of scared of this facilities- very uncomfortable... there’s a must to be described all this facilities at the stage when you’re booking your stay - as when I booked the room wasn’t specified anything about that and definitely  wouldn’t be what I could ask for.
I’m pointing all this not expecting to be recompensed for this “unexcited experience”, I just believe all this missed details can be fixed and leave an amazing impact on your customers otherwise your staff (at the reception and in the morning at the restaurant at the breakfast  - I interacted only with them) were very friendly and helpful and is sad to see your staff hard work and delivering good customer service and to loose customers for such important details that somehow been neglected.

United Kingdom,Standard Room,3,January 2020,Solo traveler," Unfriendly reception staff. No warm welcome. No explanation of facilities. Offer of restaurant booking, wake up calls etc. 
Problem with activating key cards when I arrived and had to return daily to reception to get it reactivated as it stoped working each day. Not even so much as an apology. 
Room was clean but there was mould/mildew around the window and the bath, and the toiletries and coffee were not replenished at any point during my 3 night stay. 
When I went to use the hair dryer it glowed and blue sparks came from the buttons. When I called reception to ask for another as it was broken I was given instructions on how to use it. I’m not stupid!!! However one was quickly sent up when I explained that it has stoped working after it overheated and sparks were flying. Again no word of an apology. The staff at this hotel need some serious training in attention to detail and customer service.

The room we stayed in (308) was tired, we had booked a twin room for my friends birthday. We were given a double. We were emailed about getting an early check-in and a late check-out. Both were not given to us. Response was they had sold out of these. Don't know why they were offered when neither could be accommodated. Disappointed, as it was clearly stated when we made the booking it was for my friends birthday........The pool facilities are very poor. The pics make it look far better. The pool is cold, old and tired. The sauna is good, but the steam room is luke warm, plus its up-stairs (we found it as we wete leaving). The pool and sauna is accessed via a very un-health and safety spiral staircase. 
We were phoned twice in the morning, then they hung up? This was before our check-out time of midday. The cleaner tried to get in, again before our midday check-out. Finally, we were recommend The Capital carpark by the hotel - absolute nightmare getting out and is not a 4min walk as advised.

Once entering rooms I realised that the they were both twin. after calling reception, they would not agree that there was a fault or tries to accommodate us accordingly. In fact, their response was to sort out with Booking.com, which is poor customer service. One of the rooms did not have any shower gel, just shampoo and conditioner. the same room did not have working AC and the maintenance guy offered me a fan instead, after he tried to fix (the dial was broken). I will not stay here again and do not recommend it to anyone!",5.4,Awful night stay during graduation,0,bathroom,0

New Zealand,Premium Room with River View,2,May 2019,Couple," We arrived early and we knew we would have to wait until 3pm - this was discussed and acknowledged by us up front.  However, the reception staff kept advising that it MIGHT be available earlier, so we kept hanging at the hotel, being a tad travel weary.  It would have been better to have been told that the room was definitely not available until 3pm - and not raise our expectations.  Staff at reception were unfriendly and not usefully informative.   The experience did not get better from there.  The restaurant is easily the worst one we have experienced in our travels to date (4 weeks) around Europe and UK.  Rubbery and tasteless  food on the hot plates eg: scrambled eggs sitting in their own whey three breakfasts running; the best items being the sausages, bacon and tomatoes, which were at best, tepid; coffee not pleasant, sticky tables, One evening meal not available at 8.30pm on a Saturday as had run out of food - only Room Service available (?);  Fridges in room ""being decommissioned"", so no cold water;  all the glassware etc available ..

United Kingdom,Premium Room with River View,2,March 2019,Couple," The Premium room with River view (611) is quite shabby with quite a few bits of damage, one of the reading lights is intermittent, the desk lamp does not work at all. the marble desk surface has a crack all the way across it.
The TV seems only to have 5 analogue channels and the controller is intermittent.
There are no biscuits and the mini bar has nothing in it (staff advised all room fridges had been decommissioned)
The drawers have no sides so clothing falls out. 
We have already had to make a trip to reception because both the room cards stopped working. My wife got stranded in the fitness centre vestibule because the key card did not work.
We were told free lockers were available in the fitness centre, however when we got there we were told a £1 coin is needed to rent padlocks (the attendant did lend us 2 free when we told him we had no change).
The male toilet light was faulty.
The spa area is quite shabby with various damage and areas of bare plaster, we did not feel the area was very hygienic. The changing rooms are poorly furnished with no costume dryers, unspecified product, no obvious moisturiser or conditioner.

The main lobby is very modern and clean with access into the restaurant and bar area, the check in area was a little busy but only took a few minutes to clear.
This is where we get to the bad bit... The room, from the description on the website was meant to be a really nice room.. I was visiting for birthday celebrations so naturally chose what I thought would be a nice hotel. Upon entering the room, we noted how dated the room was looking and that it was not modern to the same standard as the main lobby area.
The bed was actually quite comfortable and we had a sitting chair and a table chair along with pen, paper and a phone. The website advertised a free bottle of water in your room, this was not provided. We also wasn't informed that the mini bars in the room had been deactivated so there was no supplied stock and no where to store any chilled items we may have brought with us. The TV was a bit of a let down, it had just over 10 standard definition aerial channels, if you were lying on your bed and was trying to watch one of the channels, you would struggle due to the poor picture quality. By the windows (last couple of pictures) we have clear evidence of mold and this was one of the biggest let downs of a radisson blu hotel, I expected this to be a non-existent problem in a 4 star hotel.. How this hotel is still 4 star baffles me.
The bathroom was quite modern with a nice sink, but again we had issues with mold being around the bath and shower area. On our first night we noticed that the adjustable shower head was broken so we couldn't change the setting and the temperature was either artic or desert (freezing cold, boiling hot), there was no Inbetween.
Probably the nicest part was the downstairs spa and fitness area.",5.8,Not worth 4 Stars.,0,location,0

United Kingdom,Premium Room with River View,2,March 2019,Couple," So first impressions of this hotel were very good, the location of the hotel is pretty good too, I requested a room with a view of the river outside and the hotel provided this.
The main lobby is very modern and clean with access into the restaurant and bar area, the check in area was a little busy but only took a few minutes to clear.
This is where we get to the bad bit... The room, from the description on the website was meant to be a really nice room.. I was visiting for birthday celebrations so naturally chose what I thought would be a nice hotel. Upon entering the room, we noted how dated the room was looking and that it was not modern to the same standard as the main lobby area.
The bed was actually quite comfortable and we had a sitting chair and a table chair along with pen, paper and a phone. The website advertised a free bottle of water in your room, this was not provided. We also wasn't informed that the mini bars in the room had been deactivated so there was no supplied stock and no where to store any chilled items we may have brought with us. The TV was a bit of a let down, it had just over 10 standard definition aerial channels, if you were lying on your bed and was trying to watch one of the channels, you would struggle due to the poor picture quality. By the windows (last couple of pictures) we have clear evidence of mold and this was one of the biggest let downs of a radisson blu hotel, I expected this to be a non-existent problem in a 4 star hotel.. How this hotel is still 4 star baffles me.

Self service might be good but cant replace a proper cup of tea or coffee. Overall a very disappointing stay from a hotel brand i would have expected more from.

United Kingdom,Premium Room with River View,1,December 2018,Group," Paid £224.00 on a Sunday night for what was described as fantastic prior booking with great facilities etc etc. Well I was appalled at this hotel, firstly I paid £224 on a Sunday night, for the best room you could get (advertised as the best on booking.com) and it was no better than a travel lodge room worth £25, there was no windows that opened, there was a mini bar fridge with nothing in it and was turned off an had mold all in it so we couldn’t even put our own drinks in. The room was terrible it said we would have a river view hence the higher price, when really we had a steamed up window which over looked a building site. We was on the 5th floor and seen not even half the river due to cranes etc so we felt ripped off as we was in a less than standard room!! We then come to check out on Sunday and the lifts were broke so after waiting 15 minutes for a lift that never come we tried to find stairs down, well what a surprise we found stairs which took us to the basement and there was no way out, we had to walk half way back up and then walk to the lifts on another floor to get down. £224 is a small holiday for someone, we decided to splash out an go for the room that would make it special and it was abysmal, well over priced and I will never stay here again, not even so much as a complimentary bottle of water for £224.",4.6,Disappointing,0,price,0

We ordered 4 meals and only 3 came.. but they came sepreate, first all the chips came and a salad with no cutlery then 20 mins later the rest of the fish came by that time the chips were cold and we were missing a meal also and still no cutlery so no way of eating the food?? The second day we made the mistake again to order some room service for lunch. We ordered and after 30 mins waiting we ended up walking down ourselves. When we got down we were told by one of the staff that the food had be sitting there ready... like it's room service for a reason, then we got a chicken salad that was full of fish which resulted in us not eating it.. I've never written a review before but I felt the need to this time as we saved up so hard to come here for my mams 50th birthday.

We ordered 4 meals and only 3 came.. but they came sepreate, first all the chips came and a salad with no cutlery then 20 mins later the rest of the fish came by that time the chips were cold and we were missing a meal also and still no cutlery so no way of eating the food?? The second day we made the mistake again to order some room service for lunch. We ordered and after 30 mins waiting we ended up walking down ourselves. When we got down we were told by one of the staff that the food had be sitting there ready... like it's room service for a reason, then we got a chicken salad that was full of fish which resulted in us not eating it.. I've never written a review before but I felt the need to this time as we saved up so hard to come here for my mams 50th birthday. We were left disappointed and still waiting on the manager to get back to us just so disappointing.",5.0,Bad service,0,price,0

The first morning of our stay I asked for milk, got a rude point from the waitress to say it was in the table........

Needless to say it was sent back to the kitchen. 15 minutes later the head waiter who was the bar manager came over and said the chef had told him it was rare...... then he added that there was no more lamb, so did I want something else! My husband had by this time eaten his meal, and to be honest I had gone off eating by then....,,, you never know what happens in kitchens when someone sends something back!",6.2,The worst restaurant we have been in!,0,restaurant,0
