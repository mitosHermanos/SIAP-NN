United Kingdom,Standard Room,1,August 2020,Couple," The breakfast was included with overall price and was amazing. Staff serving at breakfast were friendly and helpful, very quick to see to your requests. Only suggestion I would have is to maybe add toast to the menu handed out so people are aware you can order toast? Apart from this though, faultless! The room was quiet, as soon as you stepped in to the room you blocked out the outside world it was quiet and relaxing. The bed is super comfy! The lightning in the bathroom is amazing too. Currently with the pandemic there is no stocked minibar and whilst some would see this as a con, I quite liked this as me and my partner chose to use this as a fridge for our drinks and water, I liked having that choice of stocked minibar or not. The staff are some of the most friendliest you will meet they show interest in your stay and travels and are very professionally dressed, they see to your requests with such friendliness. Upon check out we left our bags for a few hours in the luggage room which I think is a great addition! It truly shows the Radisson is a more upmarket hotel yet not at an upmarket cost when paired with other nearby hotels so why wouldn’t you choose a little bit of luxury with Radisson? We had a particular great experience with a reception staff member who’s name we didn’t quite catch on his badge! Ryan?

United Kingdom,Corner Suite,1,September 2018,Couple," Booked the business class suite for myself & my partner for the 1 night. Situated perfectly as we attended a show at the SSE Hydro. Staff were First Class, second to none. Extremely polite and friendly. Could not do enough for us and went out of their way to go above and beyond and exceed our expectations. Spent a bit of money of the Suite and ordered a room package for my partner as it was her birthday surprise, again exceeded expectations and we were delighted by the time, effort and thought put into it. We received 2 free drinks tokens with our package, again this was a delight to our ears. Asked staff to book us a taxi for our outing and within seconds, one was waiting at the front door. Would highly recommend and will certainly be back very soon in the future as we have stayed here many times before and I will return to start racking up the points on my Loyalty Card that I was issued.

United Kingdom,Standard Room,1,September 2019,Couple," Well, our stay was somewhat marred by a couple of problems.  First up we returned to our room (606, on the top floor) at around 9:30pm to be greeted by the most terrible noise resonating through the roof from what would appear to be the buildings cooling units above - seemingly with some rough bearings!

We went out into Glasgow and on return the whole of our landing smelt very badly of smoking.  We went into our room and it was worse - it was coming through the air conditioning.  When we advised reception they told us that we were on the floor with smoking rooms!!!  We booked a no smoking room and asked to be moved but they refused as they said all other rooms were full. This wasn't true as we looked at the availability online.  We should have been advised that we were on a smoking corridor and that our room would smell badly.  Very disingenuous of the hotel and very poor customer service when asked to be moved.  Completely spoiled our weekend away with no acknowledgement or apology from any staff.

Initially they denied having  any knowledge of a move and when I insisted that they already said we could move as we needed to get ready for a reservation at a restaurant and couldn't wait for the shower to get fixed they yielded and sent the head concierge up who was apologetic and very helpful and professional.they moved us to room 508 which was a bit nicer but had no carpets, we only assume it was a smoking room despite us asking for the room to be non smoking. All in all this visit has been disappointing and not relaxed as we had hoped it to be.

Initially they denied having  any knowledge of a move and when I insisted that they already said we could move as we needed to get ready for a reservation at a restaurant and couldn't wait for the shower to get fixed they yielded and sent the head concierge up who was apologetic and very helpful and professional.they moved us to room 508 which was a bit nicer but had no carpets, we only assume it was a smoking room despite us asking for the room to be non smoking. All in all this visit has been disappointing and not relaxed as we had hoped it to be.
Oh, and on check in I informed Cindy at reception that I hold a gold status with them. She did not offer me any upgrades so I asked for one and she immediately said that they already upgraded the room with a bigger bed...

United Kingdom,Standard Room,3,September 2019,Solo traveler," First of all this criticism is to Booking com because as a customer booking a hotel room,  I have to trust the information provided to me on the Booking.com App.
Unfortunately Booking.com really misled me and has most probably misled many other customers because the photographs Booking.com are showing for a Standard room at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Glasgow do not in any way actually resemble the actual Standard rooms at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Glasgow.
I based my choice of selecting a Standard Room on the advertised photographs shown on the Booking.com App.The photographs shown of a Standard room at the Radisson Blu hotel on the Booking.com App are of a Premium room and not a Standard Room.
This is utterly unacceptable and misleading customers.
When I  checked into the hotel and went to my room, I was shocked and very upset to find my room was bright red and had wooden flooring.
This was not want I expected and I immediately went back to the Hotel Reception desk and informed the  reception team member that I  can not stay in the room.
Thankfully the reception team offered me another room  to stay in at no extra cost which resembled the type of room being advertised on the Booking.com App for a Standard room at the Radisson Blu hotel in Glasgow.
Another issue that I found strange was that the hotel takes a £50 per night security deposit if you want to use the hotel bar after 12 midnight.
So the hotel will immediately take deposit on your credit card for you as a customer to be able to purchase drinks at the bar after 12 midnight.
The hotel bar does not take any cash as payment and will only take payment on your credit card.
I stayed 3 nights and I had to pay a deposit of £150.00.
The deposit is refunded back to your credit cards a few days after you check out.
What my point is that the hotel even after paying the £50 per night deposit still takes payments which are charged to your room account.
I do not understand the real purpose of this £50 deposit  rule.",6.7,Pleasant,0,staff,0

We had several bizarre interactions with a staff person in the lobby, whose role we are unclear on, who approached us anytime we were on our way in or out and wouldn't leave us alone (and yet was ineffective at following through on any of our requests).",4.2,"Fine for convenience, but not worth the weekend price.

United Kingdom,Junior Suite,3,October 2018,Solo traveler," MY STAY AT THE RADISSON BLU GLASGOW from 11 October to 14th October 2018
I stayed at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Glasgow from the evening of Thursday 11th October until the morning of Sunday 14th October 2018.
As this was my third visit I had booked the Junior Suite from some months in advance, having previously stayed in their standard, and then their business class occasions.  I was quoted and took what I considered a good price of £500 plus for the 3 nights.
Apart from the suite being very cold at night due to it having only wooden floors (not carpet as I had expected) everything went well until the morning of Saturday 13th October when one of the staff at Reception behaved incorrectly and was rude to me and my guests.  The member of Staff had a name tag that read Praveen.
As on previous occasions I came to Glasgow to visit my friends – a mother and her daughter.  They visited me on Friday and we sat in the seating area of my suite (which is why I booked the suite in the first place) and enjoyed lunch together in the Collage Bar.
On Saturday morning I awaited their arrival in the lobby as the Collage bar was closed and as part of the lobby was under construction I waited for them in the corner. Mr. Praveen came and asked me whether he could help, and I said I was awaiting friends.  I was friendly to him and wished him “bless you” in Hindi (I am from Malaysia) to which he was quick to say that he wasn’t Indian but that one of his parents was French…
When my friends arrived at 9.30 am  , I went to greet them, and he promptly came up and asked us where we were going so I replied to my suite whereupon he officiously told us that only 2 people were allowed in the suite due to fire regulations.  I pointed out to him that my friends were NOT STAYING and were just visiting but he insisted at which point I told him that I had a suite with a separate seating area and that was why I booked a suite and he said he would check. My guests were most offended.

United Kingdom,Superior Room,3,September 2018,Couple, Our experience of breakfast on our first morning was extremely disappointing. We had been advised that breakfast was available between 7.30 to 10.30am. However having arrived at around 9.45am most of the hot buffet dishes were almost empty also the Loren sausage and breakfast was so over cooked or over heated it was so dried up and therefore inedible. To add to this we saw all the hot dishes being switched off at 10.15am and then advised by staff that the buffet would be unavailable at 10.30! We noticed guests arriving at 10.20 and 10.25 which was unacceptable to guests as staff were starting to remove the cold items from the buffet. We are Club Carlson members and regular users of the Raddidon at London Stansted but sadly found this experience very poor. The same cut off time occurred during the next two morning of our stay.,7.1,"The service from reception front of house staff and porters was exemplary, excellent a credit to you",0,food/drink,0

I was told there is a new cook ('chef' is an honorific that has to be deserved) since I last came. Sadly it was worse. the steaks (one medium and one well done) were both burnt to a crisp and pretty clearly under weight. Servings tiny - but hardly 'fine dining'. The sauce made my colleague ill. We did not say anything - what is the point as it clearly did not make any difference before.,7.1,Room fine but do not eat here,0,food/drink,0
