Sweden,Superior Twin Room,4,February 2020,Solo traveler,"¬†The best thing about this hotel is the location. You are right in the middle of the city center. It feels as if you are in the heart of everything. The hotel is approx 5min away from the train station. Close to all restaurants and shops. It was lovely that the hotel had a sauna and a pool. There was even a ice machine in the hotel. When you went in and out from the hotel there was a place where you could get some water for free, that was nice. Even if the hotel is in the middle of everything, I appreciated it that the hotel was somewhat sound proof. You could hear people from next door going in and out but that was it. No sound from the traffic or anything, which was nice. The staff are very customer service oriented and were attentive. Awesome that there was a minibar in the room. I loved that you could use a hand control to control everything in the room. You didn't need to get out of bed to example turn off the lights or the AC etc. Overall the best thing about this hotel is the excellent location.

We also took the small boat cruise where the meeting point was at Anne Frank house, its <10 mins walk from the hotel. The Dam Square and red light district are all walking distance. There are 2 Malaysian restaurant nearby (Wau and Nyonya), where we feel like home. I would rate 10 for location.
The concierge personnel was very nice and polite. We opt for Van Gaugh museum & hardrock caf√© and decided to take a taxi from the hotel despite the suggestion from him was a tram. We realized the taxi was a bit pricey (>20 Euro for one way).

United Kingdom,Superior King Room,3,August 2020,Couple,¬†As it was my partners b day I asked for an upgrade to an executive king room. This was confirmed. Shortly before we departed for Amsterdam I asked them to reconfirm as it was a surprise. Again I was told not a problem. Arrived at the hotel  and a bit of a wait even though there were 4 staff on the front desk they seemed to be slow getting guests  checked in. We went to the room we had allocated to us only to find it was the original room we booked. The lady at the front desk made it seem as though it was my fault for not confirming again at the front desk on arrival even though I had twice by email. Eventually she offered a free room upgrade but the moment had passed for the birthday surprise so we stuck with our original room which was nice enough. The pool changing rooms were closed due to COVID so it was a case of going back to you room wrapped in a towel if you didn‚Äôt what to change in front of people. Pool was nice but the filters were really dirty inside a could have done with a clean. Due to COVID we were told the the cleaning staff wouldn‚Äôt clean the room unless requested. We requested at the front desk the next morning but no one came. Finally went to concierge as we had no fresh towels soaps or hair shampoo and literally had to beg to have someone clean the room as he said we‚Äôd now missed the cut off time for requesting the room cleaned.

New Zealand,Executive King Room with Iconic View (3 Adults),1,July 2019,Family,"¬†When I booked I had paid extra for an expensive room - Executive King room with Iconic views for 3 adults $576 NZ as we only had the one night in Amsterdam so we thought spend the extra its going to be special.  The picture of the room on booking.com looked much bigger ( there were 3 of us and looking through the photos now not sure got the room we paid for) and showed rooms with large windows - or 3 sets of french doors even -that started lower to the ground with lots of light and amazing views. The room we got had one set of windows up higher from the floor which were not easily accessible because the sofa bed was up against that wall where the window was - when we tried to open them (while standing on the sofa bed)  they had a safety restraint and opened only so far. Fair enough we thought - safety first -  So we tried to put our phone out the gap of the window to take a photo of this Iconic View and noticed there was black safety mesh net all over he outside of the building so we couldn't properly see the Iconic view or even take a picture of it through the mesh. If you are going to charge extra or even put that in the statement line in the information don't you think you should be able to see it unemcumbered? When you look at the photos online you cant see any net on the outside of the building, the rooms look a lot bigger and do not properly represent the room we actually stayed in. I did go back down to reception and query this view situation and they offered us free breakfast which was nice but I would rather have had what I thought I was paying for. I always try to avoid confusion on check in so I had already asked  - this is what we booked is this what we are getting - the answer was Yes.

Israel,Superior Twin Room,2,July 2018,Group,"¬†* I booked a twin beds room for 2 people, I emailed them in advanced to make sure that the twin beds room I ordered was ready for us before we got there. I told them in advanced that I am going to arrive at 02:00 AM.
They reassured me and confirmed that the room will be ready for us as described without any troubles.
Even though I did all of this, when I arrived I've been told that the room was given already to someone else because I arrived so late (even though I emailed in advanced that I was gonna arrive late)
and I was given a double-bed room instead.
The room is a bit tiny, but I didn't mind that as it facilitated everything I needed except the AC:
* The Air Conditioner is too weak, it couldn't compete with the hot weather in Amsterdam. It took many many hours of the AC working before the room cooled down so I could fall asleep and until the room was cool enough I couldn't fall asleep from the heat.
Actually I wanted to pay extra for a hotel with a good AC to combat the heat, but I felt like I paid the extra (compared to other results) without getting the extra AC benefit I was hoping for, for most of the night.
Overall the hotel was great, in better weathers I recommend staying in Amsterdam in this hotel.",7.5,"Nice hotel, nice location, nice staff, weak AC, does not give exact room as ordered upon arrival.",0,bed,0

United Arab Emirates,Executive King Room with Iconic View,4,January 2020,Family,"¬†1- The staff were not friendly specially the duty manager.
2- I selected rooms with iconic view and bigger size and I paid more to have the iconic view. The hotel gave me rooms with view that has external work! The hotel knows that these rooms are located in the side that has external work and yet they have offered these rooms as iconic view with higher!
3- rooms were without slippers! I requested for slippers multiple times and the provide it next day!
4- Usually, hotels provide min 2 keys for the room, this hotel provided 1 key! And after asking, they provided the second key!
5- My rooms were located in the 1st floor, and I reserved the rooms from 30 the Dec to 3rd Jan. Amsterdam was very crowded during these days and the rooms were not soundproof! So all street noise was heard very clearly in the room. It was very difficult to sleep, specially in the first 2 nights.
6- when I requested to change my rooms due to reasons I mention above, the duty manager told me that the hotel is full and they cannot change it! Without offering me a possibility to change it after the new year! When I asked them if I can cancel the reservation, very simply they said contact booking.com since the reservations was through them! Such careless shows that guests satisfaction is not in their priority!

So I showed how in my confirmation it was clearly stated that the Executive King Room had those features, I was told ‚ÄúNo, those are just the hotel features‚Äù which I replied these are clearly the room features as is under the Room features tab to what the staff member agreed.

Had to come down again and had to ask to speak to the manager, then I was told the balcony does not open anyways due to safety reasons so its the same as having a window....what kind of answer that?!

1.	 Regarding high tech, the person bringing our luggage to our room could have spent more time explaining how the TV works.  We had great difficulty understanding all the prompts and controls on the TV remote.  And of course, the TV remote indicated a low battery level.  Maybe that created some of our difficulty whenever we pressed a button expecting it to work.  Hence, never really watched TV.
2.	While I realize European hotel rooms tend to be somewhat smaller than American hotels, I find it very inconvenient not to have any chest drawers available to unpack our suitcase.
3.	Ran out of Kleenex (nose wipers) in the bathroom almost immediately after we checked in.
4.	Your hotel clerk (male) checking us in was most rude and unfriendly, as if we were disturbing his day.  Admittedly, we got to the hotel early, with the Holland America cruise ship‚Äôs early disembarkation, and your hotel clerk (female)  could not have been more friendly and courteous in helping us store our baggage and advising when it might be advisable to recheck for early check-in prior to 1400 hours.  But when we arrived shortly before 1300 hours, your male hotel clerk insisted that no rooms were available and that we could not check in before 1400 hours.  Only after we advised him that the other hotel clerk (female) advised us that most likely they would have rooms available after around 1200 hours did this hotel clerk (male) reluctantly find us a room that was available (Room 103).  
5.	That evening, we had a drink in your hotel bar.  It took between 15 and 20 minutes to get our glasses of wine after we ordered them --- Unacceptable!  While I do realize us Americans tend to be somewhat impatient, nonetheless, that was unacceptable service.

4.	Your hotel clerk (male) checking us in was most rude and unfriendly, as if we were disturbing his day.

But when we arrived shortly before 1300 hours, your male hotel clerk insisted that no rooms were available and that we could not check in before 1400 hours.  Only after we advised him that the other hotel clerk (female) advised us that most likely they would have rooms available after around 1200 hours did this hotel clerk (male) reluctantly find us a room that was available (Room 103).  
5.	That evening, we had a drink in your hotel bar.  It took between 15 and 20 minutes to get our glasses of wine after we ordered them --- Unacceptable!  While I do realize us Americans tend to be somewhat impatient, nonetheless, that was unacceptable service.

United States of America,Superior King Room,1,September 2019,Couple,"¬†Having said that, some comments:
1.	 Regarding high tech, the person bringing our luggage to our room could have spent more time explaining how the TV works.  We had great difficulty understanding all the prompts and controls on the TV remote.  And of course, the TV remote indicated a low battery level.  Maybe that created some of our difficulty whenever we pressed a button expecting it to work.  Hence, never really watched TV.

China,Superior Twin Room,4,August 2018,Couple,"¬†This hotel is the worst hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed at. It was the most terrible experience I‚Äôve ever had. Our rate was over 320 euros per night. When we arrived, a male and female receptionist gave us a very tiny room despite that this hotel was in a low season with lots of empty rooms. We tried to confirm with them that if all the rooms are same sized, and they lied by saying ‚Äòyes‚Äô. How terrible and horrible are they, trying to rip customers off. We required them to change us to a room which values the outrageous 320 euro for three times. Each time they gave us a little bigger one. If we did not insist and they would never tell the truth. Where is your integrity and honesty, this is the way you treat your guests? This is not end of story. The hotel‚Äôs alarm was triggered by a ‚ÄòGod-knows‚Äô reason. Every guest was robbed from their sleep 4 clock in the morning. Firemen appeared but found nothing like a fire warning. After over 40 minutes of this ridiculous disturbance, their pathetic explanation was ‚Äòsomething wrong with the system, not our fault‚Äô. Come on, it is your hotel, this faceless explanation is so absurd. Of course it is your fault. And also, the hotel‚Äôs staff wear so fake smiles and treat guests impatiently.
