When I mentioned it was a surprise booking for my wife's birthday and family plus we would eating in Tozi I though no more of it but the gentleman booking me said he would let them know what the occasion was, most appreciated.
What I did not expect when I returned with my wife was a bottle of champagne and a lovely selection of chocolates and fruits on a slate platter wishing my wife a happy birthday along with a card. So to the front office team and Guest Relation Manager Ara you made a special day even better. Thanks guys and girls :)

They ended up giving me a meat breakfast no meat and all that was was an egg hash brown and spinach so I’m very disssapointed. It would be nice if different dietary needs were taken into consideration and treated more equally, for example veggie bacon or veggie sausage.

There is a nice lobby in the hotel and it is in a quiet location, with comfortable rooms. There are shops (even a large Sainsburies) and restaurants close by.

However, on arrival, the lady on the concierge told us there was no such request on their system! Strange since I had email confirmation to remind them on arrival! We were offered a different room upgrade to what we had requested that didn't suit so we declined. The reception on checking-in was less than friendly - almost clinical! However, checking-out and porter staff were excellent.
The bathroom in our room was looking tired - a cracked floor tile and mastic around the bath heavily peeling away with a small amount of mould staining.

Lighting - room is TOO DARK - the entry and closet areas are so dark we couldn't see to deal with clothing in the closet. Room itself needs brighter light - we were trying to read documents and had a great deal of trouble.
Room chair - can the weird quasi-recliner and put in a comfortable chair or love seat.

The bathroom is in need of modernising as the silicone is starting to mould and the shower head is very dated and rusting 
Accssecing the bath taps and plug was also a problem as the screen seemed to limit movement .

In the time I was sat there I watched staff use these cups for their drinks, children use them as pen pots and many of them cleared into waste by breakfast staff - unbelievably wasteful and not eco-friendly.

Turkey,Superior Queen Room,1,September 2019,Family," The room 552 is not to be sold separately as it is right next to another room 554 with the same problem. 
Both rooms have an interconnecting door in between, which is far from being sound-proof. 
We could hear tour neighbours and they could hear us, even the slightest sounds. 
Very uncomfortable experience, even for one night. No privacy at all.

Australia,Superior Double Room,5,August 2019,Couple," The bathroom needed a better exhaust. It was impossible to stay in the bathroom after a shower, far too humid. I didn't like the shower over the bath, far too dangerous, & the screen was not wide enough to keep the floor dry.
I was sick with the flu during our 5 day stay, so we asked the male concierge for advice regarding nearest doctor & chemist. For the doctor he suggested that we go to one that would require a 15 minute cab drive & similar for the chemist. However, we found a doctor just 5 minutes walk away, & she dispensed the antibiotics herself!

Australia,One Bedroom Apartment,4,June 2019,Couple," Where do we start? The staff are reminiscent of Manuel from Fawlty Towers - although his command of English and perception of guest needs were superior. The fact that it is virtually impossible to find a staff-member whose first language is English means that much is lost in the translation (either deliberately or otherwise). Our one-bedroom apartment (almost 350 pounds a night) could have been good if re-furbished, but it was in an appalling state of disrepair, with cupboard doors and drawers chipped and mal-aligned, a non-working dishwasher, large gouges out of the wooden floor (and parts of it that had lifted off completely), doors that didn't shut properly, a pungent and sickening influx of onion and garlic cooking smells several times a day, tatty furniture, no table to eat at, missing and mis-matched cutlery - the list goes on! The advertised coffee pods were not replaced each day (until we asked), and our bathrobes were removed during cleaning on the second day and had to be retrieved. The housekeeping was perfunctory and erratic. An extra 12.5% was added to our room service bill (not mentioned in the menu) and the quality of the food was mediocre. We took friends to the hotel's breakfast on one morning, and it was embarrassing - tired quintessential English greasy (and cold) hot dishes (one slice or two of congealed scrambled eggs? - with slightly exotic dishes such as eggs benedict or espresso coffee an extra cost). We reported the non-working dishwasher and onion smells to housekeeping and were assured that ""maintenance"" would look at it, but nothing happened.
All of this might have been predictable and tolerable had we been paying a third of the tariff we were charged, but it was unacceptble for the price.

United Kingdom,One Bedroom Apartment,2,March 2019,Solo traveler," Check in was laborious - the two guys on the desk seemed to find it amusing to keep me waiting until they'd dealt with 'their issue'. There was no one else checking in and from what I could see, they weren't dealing with anything at all - just reveling in the fact they were keeping me waiting. 'Wait over there - we're busy with somethin' was the abrupt order. Not what I was expecting after flying back from Sydney. I was then advised I needed to come back down to reception before 2pm the next day to ensure I could keep my room for the 2nd night - even though I'd paid 2 nights in advance.  When I went to reception the staff member couldn't work out why I'd come to see them.

United Kingdom,Executive Double Room,2,January 2019,Couple," 1: Room was not ready at the check in time
2: The executive room was a lot smaller than any park plaza room I have stayed in previously 
3: I could not get to the other side of the room without banging into the desk, which was far too large for the size of the room
4: Control panel on one side of the bed was not working 
5: The advertised slippers and bathrobe were not present in the room
6: I was expecting 2 chairs in an executive room for 2, but only 1 was present
I spoke to reception about my disappointment, and was told that the room size was correct, and when I asked for an alternate I was told that there were no other rooms available, but she would get maintenance and housekeeping to address my concerns.
After then coming back from an evening out to find  none of the above issues to be resolved and no explanation or apology given I was left annoyed.
After coming back to the hotel the next evening to still be in the same situation, my patients finally broke and brought the manager up to the room to show him my concerns.
I was told that the room size was to their executive standard, but he was concerned that the other issues had not been addressed. 
Now bearing in mind that I was checking out the next morning, I was offered:
1: A change of room which I declined
2: The bathrobe and slippers were then sent up
3: A bottle of wine for the inconvenience 
4: Extra points added to my Radisson account 
50th Birthday Celebration in a nice hotel already ruined.
Jumped in the shower to finally settle down for the evening to find the flannels had been taken and not replaced.
And then just to cap it off just before check out,
Empty condom and viagra packets were found behind the television cabinet.

Croatia,Superior Double Room,3,November 2018,Group," My friend booked the room from 16.-19. November. The first night was paid in advance, so we only had to pay for 2 nights. When we came to hotel, we wanted to pay straight away, but the receptionist refused. He asked for a credit card for pre-authorization and we wanted to give the one we already paid the first night with, but he didn't want to take it. He insisted on another one instead. I gave him mine and asked what will he do with it and he said he won't take any money from it, it is only the guarantee we will pay for our stay. Next, I checked my bank account and it showed that the hotel took amount of money for 2 nights (including the deposit). I complained to another receptionist and she said the money isn't taken but ""frozen"".  Next thing, my friend's father informed her that the hotel called him on his phone and asked if he wants to pay for the rest 2 nights with that same card (the one we used for first night and the one they didn't want to take for pre-authorization) and he refused, because he knew they already have frozen our money. On Sunday we went to inform the reception about this behaviour and that we are shocked that you have guests in your hotel willing to pay, and you refuse it and then call someone who isn't there at all to pay. We explained everything all over again to another receptionist, and she apologized and asked if we want to pay now and I agreed. They said they will make the payment from frozen amount of money, but they took ANOTHER amount of money from my card which means I paid DOUBLE. I complained again to the chief desk officer and she said she will talk to accountant first thing on Monday to release the money and it will be in 3-5 working days back. TWO WEEKS passed already and my money is still missing. This can be treated as stealing. I have to say I’m truly outraged and shocked with this way of working and I travel a lot and stay in very good hotels.",4.2,Very disappointing and unpleasent,0,price,0

Few issues with room (wont go into them as they are not the reason for the poor review) which where minor. The real issue was, despite reporting the issues 3 times, they where not dealt with.
This appeared to me to be a staff problem more than an hotel problem.
The follow up resolution was excellent and what we would have expected.
I have taken a couple of weeks to reflect as sometimes spontaneous reviews are never a true reflection of a stay and it is important to point out the positives, breakfast as usual excellent, reception staff very good and follow up to problems was excellent.

Australia,One Bedroom Apartment,4,August 2018,Couple," We would stay here again because of the location, but the hotel could be even better if only there were more attention to some details. We stayed in a spacious one bedroom suite, with self-catering facilities. However, the carpets were filthy and torn/threadbare, the wooden floor in the lounge area was heavily damaged, the dishwasher didn't work (and wasn't fixed in the four days we stayed after reporting this) some light globes needed replacing, the furniture was very knocked about and internal doors were heavy to open and shut. The blind for the bathroom window was broken and the washbasin sprayed water in all directions (again, not attended to even though we had asked for it to be fixed). We needed to ask for sugar sachets (twice). Staff were friendly, but for most English was clearly their second language, and we suspect that some things just got lost in translation. What could have been an exceptional hotel (it has all the basics) was a little Fawlty Tower-ish in some aspects. The good outweighed the bad and we were in relaxed holiday mode, so we just laughed off these things, but it was sad that things could obviously have been much better with comparatively little needed to achieve that.",7.1,"Great location and fundamentally good, but some shortcomings",0,location,0

had four rooms three the same and one different type, again totally
different amenities, simple things like slippers in some but not all, no
ironing board in one but it had an iron, no face clothes in any
something there has always been in the past. Lack of loo roll, lack of
clean towels. We were asked when we checked in how many days we would
not like housekeeping, as we were there for five nights we agreed only
one, we were given a voucher worth £10 per room for money off our lounge
bar bill in exchange for no housekeeping. We in fact only had our rooms
cleaned twice and that was after we called reception to report there had
been no housekeeping done! As for the voucher you would think that would
be straight forward but no we only ended up have £2 removed from our bar
bill, (this was rectified at reception when we checked out!) I
appreciate Work needs to be carried out at some point but out of the
five days only once did all four lifts work usually only two, surly

Germany,Superior Double Room,4,August 2018,Family," There were a lot of minor flaws, which summed up to an overall disappointment. The rooms were said to be ready by 2.00 Pm, we arrived at 3:30 and the larger room was still not done. It took more than an additional hour before we were let into the room. The large room (I think it was called junior suite) was an annex on the roof and had two sides of windows and a flat roof. That caused the room to heat up quickly, during the hot days in this year's August the air conditioning could not cope with that. The cleaning staff opened the blinds every day so that the room heated up all day.
The bathroom needs renovation, the mirrors show large areas of rust. The shower cabin was severely leaking so the bathroom was flooded after each shower. 
There were no spots to hang the towels. There was no power outlet near a mirror, so using a blow dryer was kind of impossible. 
When opening the room door, the light in the bathroom was lit. It could only be switched off from a panel next to the bed - that means there was no way to discretely leave the room when one person woke up earlier, without waking the others up.
None of these flaws were major, but all in all our stay did not match the aspiration level of a park plaza hotel - nor did it match the paid price.",7.1,"Excellent location, but does not live up to the aspiration level",0,temperature,0

The rooms were said to be ready by 2.00 Pm, we arrived at 3:30 and the larger room was still not done. It took more than an additional hour before we were let into the room. The large room (I think it was called junior suite) was an annex on the roof and had two sides of windows and a flat roof. That caused the room to heat up quickly, during the hot days in this year's August the air conditioning could not cope with that.

United Kingdom,Superior Queen Room,1,August 2018,Couple," The food was absolutely disgusting! 
The cleaners knocked 3 times in the morning asking what time did we check out from 10:30 this happened when check out is at 12!
It was meant to be a chilled morning as we have young kids we wanted to make the most of the time to ourselves.! This was extremely annoying!!!
Also the lift for the car park was a joke just waiting for ages for them to open.
And then when you get to the car park downstairs it's like a car boot sale.

United States of America,Superior Double Room,6,August 2018,Solo traveler," The location was the only good thing about this hotel. But here are some bad things that I have experienced during my stay at this hotel. First night: I was in a room on the third floor. The room and furniture were literally shaking and about to collapse whenever the door in the next room was opened and closed, like an earthquake. I asked them to change it and they did, and believe or not, they said it’s so common in their hotel to hear from residents about the doors problem. Second issue: After three nights, I decided to extend my stay due to a flight change, so the hotel pre-charged my credit card 5 times during my stay!! (Before the check out time!) totally charged me for more than a double of the whole total amount of the stay. When I complained and met the duty manager, he said there is an error in the system !! And to be honest he didn’t say the truth cuz these transactions are done manually. I asked them to hold the whole amount for the stay just once, and release the rest of holding money that they hold without any reason or right! He said apologized about what happened and said okay but he didn’t know when these amount supposed to get back to my card, therefore, I was so limited financially on my card until the time of writing this comments. Third issue, with the bed: the cover sheet and pillows’ sheets smell bad, they smell like a forgotten wet towel on the couch for days without getting it dried. I asked them to change them all, the did in the next day!! Third issue: they don’t put a new bag and form for the laundry again in the closet it you already used them. So you have to call every time to ask them to bring a bad & form to put in the closet in order to use them next time. Honestly, this is NOT a good hotel to stay at when you come to London whether for a vacation or business trip!",5.4,Fair,0,location,0
