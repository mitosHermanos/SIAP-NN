South Korea,Standard Double Room - Atrium View,3,July 2019,Solo traveler," The hotel is very centrally located. The rooms are very clean and in good condition for this hotel standard. I got a room on the 12th floor and I was told it is an upgrade to the Atrium room I originally booked. However, I did not find anything particular about the room neither in size nor with its overall level as it was in my opinion just a standard room as I would expect it from this hotel category.
Positive to mention is also that the staff was very kind and supportive. I arrived at 9am. Of course the room was not ready but the staff gave me access to the gym and pool area were I  could relax and also take a shower.

From the doormen at the door always willing to help us with our baby pram, to the staff at the buffet breakfast-everyone was willing to go the extra mile to make our stay more comfortable.

That's fine so I went to reception (3m away) and confirmed myself. Then I went to inform the porter that I was indeed checked out. The concierge got himself involved for no reason to confuse things. Fine.
Then after everything was solved, no thank to the concierge, he decided to move from his desk and approach me in the waiting area to inform me that concierge and reception are two different things and that he cannot pass messages on (3m to his right).
If that's a rule, fine.
He then went on to lecturer me the difference between a concierge and reception and that ""I might not be able to COMPREHEND the difference""
My reply was swift.
As an international pilot, I assure you I can comprehend the difference and in fact I am very familiar with a far more impressive service than yours.

Unfortunately, the beds were pretty small doubles, so I can only imagine they were smaller than the standard double room bed size, which is understandable if one person is anticipated to sleep in each bed, but as a couple, I don't know if this was really a good upgrade to have been given. Additionally, there was loud music playing until the early hours of the morning, which didn't help with obtaining a comfortable nights sleep. In the morning, we had also paid for breakfast to be included. On making our way to the breakfast room we were taken to a table and given a menu with priced item, no explanation.

We proceeded to ask about the breakfast, being understanding that buffet style is not suitable in the current global situation, but being a little confused having been given a menu with different prices and options and not knowing what exactly our prepayment entitled us to. Once explained we ordered from the menu as directed, however the resulting dishes were disappointing at most.
