Netherlands,Executive Room with Lounge Access,7,February 2020,Family," We stayed in this hotel for 7 nights. Booked executive room with access to the executive lounge. After our arrival there was a small miscommunication about additional bed for our daughter but the manager solved this perfectly!
Rooms are spacious and clean. Swimming pool is not too big but perfectly okay for a short swim (water very nice warm). Also for relaxing time the area is big enough.
Access to the business lounge is great. Between 17:00 and 19:00 food and drinks (alcohol included) for free. Breakfast here is also fine and quiet. 
The staff jn the business lounge is great and very helpful. My advice is to leave a small tip when you leave. Will be very much apriciated. 
If you need taxi take a regular one (just ask for it and staff will arrange one). The private taxis at the hotel are 2.5 time more expensive. 
Area is close to the down town (Burj Khalifa) = 15 Dirham by taxi = 10 minutes. To the La Mer beach = 25 Dirham = 15 minutes.  
To the Atlanis (Palm Beach) = 30 minutes = 70 Dirham.

South Africa,Standard Room with Burj Khalifa View,1,January 2020,Couple," The hotel is well located, in that it's close to Business Bay Metro station (a bit of a trek with a 20kg bag, but even with that, I actually walked from the Metro to the hotel and was quite alright). The staff are incredible at all times everywhere from check in to check out. The room (1518) was functional in design yet pretty. Amenities great. The Burj view is a great bonus if it's your first time to Dubai. The Makar was a lovely upperclass pub vibe for the evening, and a fun quiz night (although the content too long and complex for us after a day of travel) was a bonus. The Fireroom restaurant has incredible views - excellent food too. The hot water did not work in our first room for a day (my husband having arrived before me for work), so when I arrived the following day I asked them to attend to sorting that out. There was an engineering issue being resolved after a pipe burst or something (not something they can control or pre-plan for, so I don't see it as a negative). The staff quickly moved us to a much bigger suite on the 15th floor without hassle or charge. It made my first night in Dubai quite special.",8.0,Excellent city hotel,1,location,0

The only thing I think they could have done it better, is the breakfast and the happy hour - for the rooms with the lounge access. I would suggest that you introduce something fresh to the table, something simple like tomatoes or cucumbers, as well for the happy hour. In eight days of stay, there was the same frozen/fried spring rolls and fish for happy hour. It can be enough to have at least 3 varieties during the week, and with few adjustments the whole experience can change for the best!",8.0,Very Good,1,staff,0

Ive checked-in after midnight, completely wasted and Ive been upgraded to a suit with balcony, a view of water and Burj Khalifa as well [ first thing in a morning was selfie with Burj Khalifa and coffee at the balcony}
 breakfast is great here - huge selection of different kind of fruits, pastries, European breakfast, middle east breakfast...everything you wish for
- at the day of my departure Ive asked for late check-out as I was moving to another hotel by the beach where check-in was at 3PM and receptionist was so kind, he let me stay till 2PM
- its 15minutes easy walk to Dubai mall but ofc no one ""walks "" in Dubai :-) :-) so everybody will be supershocked if you asked them if you can walk to the mall. me and my collegues we were also taking taxis 3 days and the very last evening we realized its very simple to walk from/to the Dubail mall
- definitely recommened this hotel if you need to stay around business bay! I myself for sure will return to this hotel when in Dubai for business next time",10.0,"amazing staff, perfect service, great hotel - 15mins walk to Dubai mall",1,location,0

Egypt,Executive Room with Lounge Access,5,October 2019,Solo traveler," My experience with this hotel was simply amazing! 
My flight came in early at 8:00 am on a Friday and I was granted a room within an hour of my arrival..The room was very clean and spacious but overlooked a building that was under construction..Immediately I was given the choice of two alternative rooms and I selected one that was very quiet, more spacious, and had a breathtaking panoramic view of the waterfront!
The breakfast offered a wide variety of high quality food..Everything was spotless clean in the restaurant and throughout the hotel..Housekeeping was extremely efficient..The gym was well-equipped and overlooked the waterfront as well..
The strongest asset of this hotel are its staff who get out of their way to please their guests with a big smile! Special thanks goes out to Belin at the reception frontdesk who was always corteous, helpful, very amiable and consistently made sure that I receive a VIP treatment..
I wish this hotel and its dedicated staff all the best in forthcoming years! This hotel is sure to be my destination in any upcoming visits to the magnificent city of Dubai!",10.0,Outstanding!,1,dirty,0

Australia,Executive Room with Lounge Access,3,September 2019,Couple," It was a beautiful hotel with great facilities and helpful and friendly staff. We stayed three nights and our room was spacious and we were fortunate to receive an upgrade on our arrival. 
It was very quiet in our room and we didn’t hear any noise to disturb us. 
The bed was so comfortable and our room was serviced each day. 
It was also great to be able to access the day lounge and make a cup of tea and have a light snack. Breakfast was amazing too and a wide selection to choose from. We appreciated the warm arrival when going down to breakfast too.
There was nothing more that we wanted and we would definitely recommend this hotel.

We were met by Ferdi who immediately gave us some great information about places nearby--to eat and to visit.  He always was more than just informative and went out of his way to help us get oriented.  Also, we were helped very much by Roshan who was there at 5:00 am to help us with our luggage and get us off to the airport with coffee in our hands and sweet rolls, too.  Also, David was infinitely helpful in many questions we had and one of the reasons we canceled our other hotel at the airport and spent another night at Radisson Blu instead  Also, the location was superior and within walking distance of the Dancing Fountains, the Mall and the Burj Khalifa.
We ate one dinner there and it was delicious.  We ate during happy hour out on the front on the patio-- bar area.  We had mussels which were both beautifully cooked and served.

United States of America,Standard Room with Burj Khalifa View,4,May 2019,Solo traveler," Not sure where to start for this review. I had all names listed as the staff was beyond amazing the whole stay I was there. They looked after me and my needs and they were all spectacular. 
Regina at reception was incredible, loved her and I have more names to mention. Everything was goin well, until the last night I was in the hotel, I got stolen exactly 270 Euros from a bunch of euros notes I had, sure the robber would think that I would not notice but I knew exactly how much I had after I had withdrawn the amount and left the euros untouched.
Found my stuff moved in different ways including my paperwork and reading book took a different location on my desk. Having OCDs and being a true traveler as well as an ex, Hotel Manager for the same company, Radisson, I realized right on the spot that things were not the same order as I always observe things. It took hours to get me count my money as I would have never thought something like this can even happen until I was packing to head to the airport and when was preparing all the tips in small envelopes, I realized my money was touched when I had the bigger bills on top of my smaller bills. I did not even want to believe at first, but it’s what it is, it had happened. 
Such a shame that one bad apple, ruined my vacation and left me so disappointed mostly when I know, my personal things have all been abused and touched including my underwear pocket.
The hotel promised they will investigate. Vanessa and James (Security and Guest Relations) were kind and helpful to come to my room at 3am before I packed for the airport and assured me things will be looked at. Until now, I have no feedback and I will be escalating this legally as I had personally called police and demanded for finger prints checking as well. Hoping I can get some feedback as I will feel much better to leave a better feedback for the hotel as if it was not for this experience, I would have had an incredible stay.",3.3,"Stolen money from my room!

Australia,Standard Room,3,April 2019,Couple," Well to begin with the air conditioning wasn’t working properly and we had to call engineering in the night before bed because the room was getting too cold even though it was set at 26.5 degC.

Russia,Premium Room with Balcony and Burj Khalifa View,5,January 2021,Couple," When we arrived to the hotel we had 2 different booking reservations, since the extension was not possible via Booking. I have confirmed the same room with the hotel staff prior to check in and they assured me in writing that I will retain the room for the entire duration of my stay. However, when we arrived the receptionist asked again about the bookings and I had to explain from the beginning what was the issue. We checked in into our room and while the view was nice, the room itself was:
- Very old
- Dusty and not clean
One day when we came to the room in the afternoon after an exhausting day exploring the city, we found that our key was not working. In other words, we were simply locked out of our room. I then remembered that it was the day when we were supposed to ""check out"" according to our first booking. And indeed, when we arrived at the reception they acted like they had no idea about the second booking. And to make it even ""better"" now they were saying that our second booking featured a STANDARD room, while we were staying at the premium room with Burj Khalifa view. I was completely shocked by such incompetence. After 40 minutes of arguing the issue was resolved, but I sure didn't want to spend my time like this on holidays. I'd expect a free breakfast or at least a drink in return to such horrible treatment, and the hotel didn't offer a single thing.
As for the room service:
- Our bedsheets/bed linen were not changed the entire week
- We were missing towels a few times
- Shampoos and soaps are very low quality

Russia,Premium Room with Balcony and Burj Khalifa View,5,January 2021,Couple," When we arrived to the hotel we had 2 different booking reservations, since the extension was not possible via Booking. I have confirmed the same room with the hotel staff prior to check in and they assured me in writing that I will retain the room for the entire duration of my stay. However, when we arrived the receptionist asked again about the bookings and I had to explain from the beginning what was the issue. We checked in into our room and while the view was nice, the room itself was:
- Very old
- Dusty and not clean
One day when we came to the room in the afternoon after an exhausting day exploring the city, we found that our key was not working. In other words, we were simply locked out of our room. I then remembered that it was the day when we were supposed to ""check out"" according to our first booking. And indeed, when we arrived at the reception they acted like they had no idea about the second booking. And to make it even ""better"" now they were saying that our second booking featured a STANDARD room, while we were staying at the premium room with Burj Khalifa view. I was completely shocked by such incompetence. After 40 minutes of arguing the issue was resolved, but I sure didn't want to spend my time like this on holidays.

- At checkin-in the lady wasn't very kind, nor did she provide much info about the general things until we asked about them (which floor the breakfast is, which floor the pool is on, etc)
- We booked a room for 2 adults and 2 children. The sofa bed was not prepared, so we had to show our booking first that we had requested it before it was arranged. 
- We had luggage in the trunk of our renter car, as well as 1 piece of luggage on the backseat because it didn't fit. The only luggage brought to our room was the one from the back seat.

- Since they knew our booking was for 4 people, we found only 2 towels in the room. We complained and got 2 more towels. Then the next day we were again down to 2 towels. So we had to ask about it again. 
- The next day, the basic things such as shower gel, shampoo etc, weren't even refilled that were empty. The basic things you even get in a 3-star hotel could not be executed in this 5-star hotel. 
- We asked for a basic thin cover for our kids, because the one provided was one of those thick and warm fleece blankets. After 30 minutes waiting, a staff member shows up with the exact same blanket. I explain and show him that we already have that one, and that we would like a thinner one. Waiting another 15 minutes he just returns with the same one. 
- On our last evening we asked the reception if it would be possible to get a small package for breakfast, since we had to checkout the next morning at 5am. He said that it would be no problem, and it would be ready for us at checkout. Next morning, nothing was ready.

United Kingdom,Standard Room,2,December 2020,Solo traveler," I had breakfast in The Larder and it was awful. It's buffet service and it feels like a race by the staff to get you served and out.  If you find everything you want to eat as you enter the ""Buffet area"" that's luck. Anything, other than the food displayed is ordered and takes a while - 15 mins for a fried egg. I could have had scrambled eggs, but fancied a fried egg - 15 mins later, it arrived, after I had eaten the rapidly cooling bacon and mushrooms... I left soon after with indigestion.  
This is a Business meeting / conference type hotel and not for tourists, unless you want to be quite close to the Shopping malls, Burj Khalifa, etc. It' also good for smokers in Makar - the Scottish Bar. Not great if you are a non smoker. I didn't see any other smoking areas in Dubai....!!
Fortunately, I had spent the previous 9 days at another hotel near the Marina and the contrast is unbelievable...

United Kingdom,Standard Room,2,December 2020,Solo traveler," I had breakfast in The Larder and it was awful. It's buffet service and it feels like a race by the staff to get you served and out.  If you find everything you want to eat as you enter the ""Buffet area"" that's luck. Anything, other than the food displayed is ordered and takes a while - 15 mins for a fried egg. I could have had scrambled eggs, but fancied a fried egg - 15 mins later, it arrived, after I had eaten the rapidly cooling bacon and mushrooms... I left soon after with indigestion.  
This is a Business meeting / conference type hotel and not for tourists, unless you want to be quite close to the Shopping malls, Burj Khalifa, etc. It' also good for smokers in Makar - the Scottish Bar. Not great if you are a non smoker. I didn't see any other smoking areas in Dubai....!!

And after several calls, bread was brought, and the biggest surprise when we came back in the middle of the night the dishes were still in the room.

Belgium,Standard Room,2,November 2019,Family," It’s quite a list unfortunately: we arrived and couldn’t enter the room, so we had to upgrade and then we could go in another room (what a coincidence that only rooms more expensive are available and never a cheaper one...). Here starts the bad experience of only paying more for a disappointment.
Hotel staff at the check-in was not friendly and communicated very badly, making me feel ripped-off by a third class hotel chain (which I don’t expect from R Blu!)
The building is not as clean as a typical R Blu, even dirty in some areas.
The breakfast could’ve been more diversified, almost no fruit, no pancakes etc. I at least expect some regional fruit like dates.

United States of America,Standard Room with Burj Khalifa View,4,May 2019,Solo traveler," Not sure where to start for this review. I had all names listed as the staff was beyond amazing the whole stay I was there. They looked after me and my needs and they were all spectacular. 
Regina at reception was incredible, loved her and I have more names to mention. Everything was goin well, until the last night I was in the hotel, I got stolen exactly 270 Euros from a bunch of euros notes I had, sure the robber would think that I would not notice but I knew exactly how much I had after I had withdrawn the amount and left the euros untouched.
Found my stuff moved in different ways including my paperwork and reading book took a different location on my desk. Having OCDs and being a true traveler as well as an ex, Hotel Manager for the same company, Radisson, I realized right on the spot that things were not the same order as I always observe things. It took hours to get me count my money as I would have never thought something like this can even happen until I was packing to head to the airport and when was preparing all the tips in small envelopes, I realized my money was touched when I had the bigger bills on top of my smaller bills. I did not even want to believe at first, but it’s what it is, it had happened. 
Such a shame that one bad apple, ruined my vacation and left me so disappointed mostly when I know, my personal things have all been abused and touched including my underwear pocket.
The hotel promised they will investigate. Vanessa and James (Security and Guest Relations) were kind and helpful to come to my room at 3am before I packed for the airport and assured me things will be looked at. Until now, I have no feedback and I will be escalating this legally as I had personally called police and demanded for finger prints checking as well. Hoping I can get some feedback as I will feel much better to leave a better feedback for the hotel as if it was not for this experience, I would have had an incredible stay.",3.3,"Stolen money from my room!

So they had 3 weeks between booking and check in and nobody contact me to notify they may have problems with rooms. I come to hotel after night flight and I didn't want to argue with them. So I agreed to pay additional 30$ for night to get better room with extra bed. It wasn't my problem that they hadn't room I had booked but I still payed. The most disappointing fact that I paid and I didn't get my extra bed. I was waiting two nights. When I started arguing with manager I got my bed in ten minutes.

So tough noogies you missed the cleaning as they either clean at their convenient time or they will never clean. Furthermore, when they come up and clean, they do it improperly!
Room service is another disaster, the menu has little options and all of their food is old, but reheated! I could tell from the taste of the chicken and the old bread!
The reception guy was trying to convince me when I first arrived to upgrade my room and pay AED 900 but I refused then he gave me a lower price AED 700 but I refused again and then he told me that he got me a better and bigger room, but he gave me the worst room.

Belgium,Standard Room with Burj Khalifa View,4,February 2019,Solo traveler," I really don't like to criticize but this was by far my worst staying in a hotel. The service it is not a 5 Star hotel. I arrived at 2.30 am and my room , together with other 10 guests was not ready. They had a problem with their cleaning service, and the reception couldn't provide us information how long we need to wait. The hotel were proposing to go to another Radisson Blu hotel , which we had to pay, and for the taxi as well. Taking in consideration it was middle of the night and a lot of us had work the next morning, this was really annoying. Finally at 4am I could receive a standard room, and next day move to my initially booked room. I didn't receive any commercial gesture, just a juice with a note in my room as apology . 
The room wasn't 100% clean as I could see the dust under furniture. The cleaning lady forgot to put hands towels  the second day. 
The third day , I could see a dirty towel trolley next to my room , I thought it will be removed, but the next morning it was still there.
I don't want to be impolite, especially because I am member of Radisson hotels, and never experienced this, but for a 5 Star hotel, you cannot afford these little mistakes.
I am in Dubai often for work, but I will not stay in this hotel anymore.",5.4,Not what i expected,0,staff,0

The room has not been made up despite us being away from the room from 11am till 5pm and having ""please make up room"" sign. So we didn't have fresh towels for our second night.
The window in the room was extremely dirty when we checked in so we had to clean it ourselves. There was also a coffee glass with clearly visible fingerprints as if it was never washed.
The location is just awful. It's kind of close to the metro but because there are construction everywhere and freeways you can't get there without a taxi.
The check-in clerk offered us a suite upgrade with Burj Khalifa view but the suite was actually a business meeting room (useless to us leisure travelers) attached to a bedroom and the Burj Khalifa was only visible from the meeting room and not from the bedroom. His price offer for the upgrade was also higher than publicly available price at the moment of upgrade and he refused even to match them. When confronted of all the problems we had during the stay on the check out he just said that he's sorry and it's not acceptable in a 5-star hotel; without offering any refund nor even waiving the upgrade fees (I'm used to Radisson Blu in other countries easily offering halving the cost of my stay when I have a minor hiccup and didn't even ask for a refund).

The window in the room was extremely dirty when we checked in so we had to clean it ourselves. There was also a coffee glass with clearly visible fingerprints as if it was never washed.
The location is just awful. It's kind of close to the metro but because there are construction everywhere and freeways you can't get there without a taxi.
The check-in clerk offered us a suite upgrade with Burj Khalifa view but the suite was actually a business meeting room (useless to us leisure travelers) attached to a bedroom and the Burj Khalifa was only visible from the meeting room and not from the bedroom. His price offer for the upgrade was also higher than publicly available price at the moment of upgrade and he refused even to match them. When confronted of all the problems we had during the stay on the check out he just said that he's sorry and it's not acceptable in a 5-star hotel; without offering any refund nor even waiving the upgrade fees (I'm used to Radisson Blu in other countries easily offering halving the cost of my stay when I have a minor hiccup and didn't even ask for a refund). We ended up paying ridiculously high amount per night for an extremely awful stay and all we got is ""sorry"".
We've stayed in 14 hotels ranging from 3 to 5 stars in 5 different countries on this trip and this was definitely the worst.",4.2,Stay away,0,price,0

Sweden,Executive Room with Lounge Access,5,January 2019,Solo traveler," Couple of things: the communication between the room and room service:
Perhaps my misunderstanding but couple of times during my stay I was told that they will get back to me and somehow that part fell between the chairs. When asked about some information, they promised to get back to me but it could take some hours before feedback.
I did not like the fact that bedsheet was not changed during my entire stay, not even once. I stayed more than 5 nights. First two nights I locked myself into the room and I put up the not disturb sign. But afterwards, the room was cleaned 3 times during my stay and not once was the bedsheet changed.
I dont know why but I did not feel the warm welcoming look from some staff members couple of times which made me uneasy.
If arriving at breakfast at 10:45, first thing you heard was the stress tone the person had in their voice as if they wanted everyone to leave at 11:00 sharp. This happened to me when I just went down to get a banana due to the state I was in and then I heard this being said to another person two days later when I was heading out from the breakfast.
The staff members and their facial expressions and tone of their voice can make a large difference and unfortunately some staff members just made me feel very uneasy and very not welcomed.
When I was going to be visited by a male friend of mine: they told me that they will make an exception this once and will let him up to the room due to restrictions...but the same person on the phone could not answer me why my same friend was let up to my room without any problems a day earlier.

Germany,Standard Room,3,January 2019,Family," However, at the front office check-in desk (Ms. Koushika- I do not understand how she made to hospitality industry), I was told to wait for few hours during Check-in (Checkin time was 15:00 hrs). She might never stayed in a five star hotel and had experience as a guest (but neither as host too). I pay for my room and its the hotel responsibility to provide a room exactly during the check-in time you state on your hotel policies. In my case, This was not even an early check-in. These apprentices should have been trained to behave and to overcome their daily stress before been put on to the front desk to handle individuals who stay at these exclusive group of hotels which is a 5 Star!!
I was informed by her, that She could not manage to provide a room which I booked for 2 adults and one child which I booked 45 days before arrival. She yet argues that this is only possible based on availability. (To fix availability for 45 days  huh!!!?).

I was missing for instance a really good minibar, and also service between hours to check and amend the room not just in the morning. I asked a couple of times if I could borrow a phone charger and they couldn't offer the facility...",5.8,Good breakfast,0,location,0

Philippines,Standard Room,1,August 2018,Family," We waited for an hour to check in. They said they had upgraded our room so we have to wait until housekeeping is done cleaning our room. We arrived at 3pm in the hotel and our room is still not ready. At first 10-15 minutes was fine, but then of course we are very tired from our trip from Abu Dhabi to Dubai. Not to mention we have our 21 months old toddler with us. We were exhausted when we arrived in the hotel, but then had to wait for an hour for them to check us in.
One more thing, we went to the pool like around 830am and we set our room to clean, but nobody came to clean our room till we finished swimming around 10am.",6.7,Good,0,dirty,0

South Africa,Superior Room with Balcony,1,August 2018,Couple," Building finishings poor. Moulding and tiling  looks like it was done by unskilled labour. Unfit for a 5 star building. Food served at breakfast was off a very low standard. Not appetising at all.
Noisy with construction noise throughout the night",5.8,Unworthy of 5 star rating,0,food/drink,0
