The room which had been upgraded for us by the hotel was exceptional. We stayed in a one bedroom king suite with the view of the Big Ben, River Thames and London Eye. The view was so beautiful at night. Opted in for a few upgrades as it was my partners birthday so went for prosecco on arrival, and the 'celebration package' which included more prosecco in an ice bucket, balloons which were blown up around lounge area and a hand-made cake. Breakfast each morning was hosted in the hotel restaurant and was a english breakfast buffet-style.

United Kingdom,One-Bedroom Suite with Balcony and River View,2,January 2020,Couple," There’s not one thing I didn’t like about the property, only the fact I couldn’t afford to stay there longer! The staff were so accommodating and attentive.

They then humiliated me in front of other guests making me wait there until they had confirmed this with reception as if I was telling lies!!!!!
I have booked a return visit for two nights at the end of March and will be expecting a better room and better treatment. I have booked to stay in the plaza on the river and look forward to your reply.

Switzerland,Superior Double Room,2,November 2018,Solo traveler," Not much.
We changed rooms 3 times as the first 2 were in the middle of a renovation and there were tools on the floor in the corridor and the whole etage smelt of paint.
The second 2 rooms on the 8th floor, one had water drippjng through the ceiling and smelt of smoke, in the other there was something wrong with the air conditioning and the room was like a sauna. We complained to the manager who was very nice and actually upgraded us, but it was still very time consuming.
The drinks in the bar were exorbitant, 11 pounds for a small aperol spritz, no crisps or nuts either. You couldn't get a coffee in the bar before 11 oclock if you were not having breakfast which was both ridiculous and very annoying as because  the hotel isn't very central we had to walk for about 30 minutes to find somewhere.
Then to top it all on the second night of our stay the fire alarm went off at 22.45, which was extreemly frightening as we were on the 14th floor.When we arrived outside in bare feet and dressinggowns we were told by a guy smoking outside the hotel that it was a false alarm...... no one from reception apologised or gave us any explanation which we found atrocious, we returned to our rooms rather worried and as you can imagine we didn't sleep very well.
We were all really disappointed with lots of things, the reception gave us no information of where anything was when we checked in, so I think they definitely need some training in customer relations.
Most of the staff didn't acknowlege you in the corridors which isn't very  good either.

The second 2 rooms on the 8th floor, one had water drippjng through the ceiling and smelt of smoke, in the other there was something wrong with the air conditioning and the room was like a sauna. We complained to the manager who was very nice and actually upgraded us, but it was still very time consuming.
The drinks in the bar were exorbitant, 11 pounds for a small aperol spritz, no crisps or nuts either. You couldn't get a coffee in the bar before 11 oclock if you were not having breakfast which was both ridiculous and very annoying as because  the hotel isn't very central we had to walk for about 30 minutes to find somewhere.
Then to top it all on the second night of our stay the fire alarm went off at 22.45, which was extreemly frightening as we were on the 14th floor.When we arrived outside in bare feet and dressinggowns we were told by a guy smoking outside the hotel that it was a false alarm...... no one from reception apologised or gave us any explanation which we found atrocious, we returned to our rooms rather worried and as you can imagine we didn't sleep very well.
We were all really disappointed with lots of things, the reception gave us no information of where anything was when we checked in, so I think they definitely need some training in customer relations.
Most of the staff didn't acknowlege you in the corridors which isn't very  good either.

United Kingdom,Superior Twin Room,1,September 2018,Family, Booked a room for my partner and I and requested a cot for my 14 month old baby ahead of booking. This was confirmed.

After a debate about child safety and a mattress we left for a few hours. The manager promised to resolve it prior to us coming back and to phone. No phone call! We got back to the room and the travel cot had been lined with towels by head of house keeping! Apparently no mattresses are provided and no one has ever complained before. It took till 7pm to have to move rooms and I had to sleep with the baby in the bed and ensure he did not fall out! They did give us complementary room service but I would have preferred a safe place for my baby to sleep! Cleanliness in rooms was not great either. On a positive note the location is great and the swimming pool! Staff need training as it was like the computer says NO! The hotel is not suitable for young children.,5.4,Fair,1,bed,0

United Kingdom,Family King Studio with Kitchenette,1,February 2020,Family, Because I had stayed before it was my wife’s birthday so arrange a treat for all the family so booked 3 rooms a family room for my son and his 2 children. I pre arrange a cot before arrival. But when he arrived to his room there was no cot or any bed made up for his daughter. They also discovered the main bed was broken. Reported this to reception who said they would deal with this and visited the room and said the bed could not be fixed. They changed the room and promised a cot as we had dinner arrangements. When we arrived back to the Hotel around 7.30 as my grandson is only 1 they went back to the room to find there was no cot? My son came back to reception to repot this again they said they would get this sorted. After 20 minutes still no cot had arrived. So I asked at reception as it was past my grandsons bed time. They said they wound speak with housekeeping. I did comment that this was the third time we had asked about a cot also it had been pre arranged. They said they would get straight onto it. It took in all over a hour which I found was unacceptable and spoilt the weekend and the surprise birthday with no apologies.,8.8,Excellent,0,bed,0

Qatar,Executive Double Room - River View,6,January 2020,Family," Park Plaza is a very comfortable and well located hotel to stay in.This was my 4th stay. Their room service staff is polite, professional and very efficient BUT, the Housekeeping Department is not at all at par with the rest of the hotel. I had to ask the people concerned in the lobby EVERYDAY to make sure my room was cleaned as it wasn't done on the 2nd day. Moreover even though I requested a change of sheets on my 4th day, all they did was change 2 of the pillow covers and duvet cover. The bed sheet, which needs to be changed more often was not!!
I stayed there for 6 days but my bedsheet wasn't changed! Even after speaking to people at the desk.
It was futile calling housekeeping and get into an arguement with someone there (and I spoke to them quite a few times to ask again and again for face towels and for laundry etc), as almost everyone I spoke to in Housekeeping didn't seem to understand English or in fact even spoke it clearly. Park Plaza really needs to improve their Housekeeping services.",7.0,Good,0,comfort,0

I had to ask the people concerned in the lobby EVERYDAY to make sure my room was cleaned as it wasn't done on the 2nd day. Moreover even though I requested a change of sheets on my 4th day, all they did was change 2 of the pillow covers and duvet cover. The bed sheet, which needs to be changed more often was not!!
I stayed there for 6 days but my bedsheet wasn't changed! Even after speaking to people at the desk.
It was futile calling housekeeping and get into an arguement with someone there (and I spoke to them quite a few times to ask again and again for face towels and for laundry etc), as almost everyone I spoke to in Housekeeping didn't seem to understand English or in fact even spoke it clearly. Park Plaza really needs to improve their Housekeeping services.",7.0,Good,0,location,0

We had asked for a table and were told to sit anywhere, when we did sit at a table and asked for a menu for food once we'd got drinks with our kids, she got really upset with us, made us get off the table and waved us to the bar area, no other tables available so we went back and asked her to show us to where she meant, and she was less than happy to help show us by walking with us , then shoved 2 tables together, she was really annoyed, as though we were asking just too much, rude!!!",8.8,"2nd stay, some minor blips but good stay.",0,tv,0

United Kingdom,Suite - River View,1,December 2019,Family," We should have been able to book into our two rooms from 2pm. This was an 80th birthday present for my Dad. We arrived at 3.30pm to a long queue and were then causally informed the room with a river view wouldn’t be ready for a ‘long time’ due to previous guests leaving late. We were told to come back in an hour which is completely unacceptable. Came back after about 40 mins and complained to another receptionist who unfortunately didn’t appear to have a full grasp of English - we seemed to be at cross purposes. I emphasised that there wasn’t going to be a lot of point in booking a room with a view if it was dark by the time we got it, but she just kept reassuring me we would get a room with a view! I offered to clean the room myself as I really wanted my Dad to see the view in daylight. Eventually Mark came to the rescue. He took charge of the situation, and discovered the room we were supposed to have hadn’t even begun to be cleaned. He then moved heaven and earth to get us transferred to the sister half of the hotel and upgraded us to a much better suite and view of the river with the Houses of Parliament. He definitely saved the day and for us the reputation of the hotel. But it had taken an hour and 40 minutes for us to get my Dad into his room, so we weren’t able to fit in a pre-theatre meal.
The only other downsides were no one answered the phone when I had a query late at night - and the next morning the phone kept ringing but there was no one there when I answered it. You have to get all the information about breakfast times/location and the pool from the TV channel - a paper guide would be good, especially for older guests. Breakfast was great for us but by the time we left at 9.10am there was a massive queue - so best to go early.",8.3,Poor first impressions but improved,0,location,0

Told would take 10mn so waited an hour. It had not been done. So had to go back to reception from 15th floor & they got house keeping onto it. So we were then in the room & had already shifted table & chairs to make room for twin bed to be shifted to the right. There was only one packet of biscuits in the room & one bottle of water for 2 people. So I asked for 3 bottles & 3 biscuits to make up for lack of these & for inconvenience that bed still not done after an hour! Also told the view we had in the upgrade was lovely but it was of the hotel opposite, you could nearly see into the room.

Ireland,Executive Double Room - River View,2,August 2018,Couple," Working for years in hospitality, regretfully I must say that our trip was not was I would expect from a 4 star hotel.
It was a special occasion and I requested prior check in what I consider a fair and simple request: to leave a note in the bedroom upon arrival and a room with bath. What is my surprise when at check in, there is no notification received even thought the several emails sent (via booking.com and directly to the property). This said, I would like to personally thank Monica (I believe this was her name if I remember correctly), as she was extremely nice and professional, and she reassured that at least we got the room with the bath. Due to the lack of preparation of my two requests (and even though I really appreciated her work, the room was not cleaned upon arrival and there was dust all over the furniture - not a severe case, but I am allergic to dust & thankfully this was more or less solved the morning after). We received later on some macaroons in the room, I believe thanks to Monica too - Italian speaker - great attention to detail.
I must say that we also got a room in a floor where some maintenance work was getting done, therefore we could find dust, paint, and dirtiness all over the hall, and experienced some maintenance noises during early hours of the morning.
The room did not have a proper table for having breakfast (one chair on a working desk and one sofa with a bed table), which is a shame, taking into consideration the wonderful views and the potential guest experience, so it was not really comfortable or nice to use and pay for the room service (plus, I would like to mention that I personally find ridiculous to charge 21 pounds for a breakfast that is consisted in literally 6 pieces of food - it is weird to provide with a full selection of marmalade but no bread or bun or whatever to spread it...).",7.1,Good,0,bathroom,0

United Kingdom,One-Bedroom Suite with Kitchenette and Balcony - River View,2,July 2020,Couple," ****** THIS REVIEW IS FOR PARK PLAZA WESTMINSTER, THE RIVERBANK HOTEL WAS NOT READY SO WE WERE MOVED.******
I paid for a suite and received a glorified hall way that could just about fit a bed in... We were sold this as an upgrade from the room I had booked.
I included breakfast in the booking... On the first day this breakfast was an hour late, cutting into our day. When I called down to see why it was an hour late and where it was the staff member was combative as if we had somehow done something wrong to make the breakfast late.
I instructed her that it would be good manners to apologise rather than try and blame us for their obvious failings and she all of a sudden found her customer service hat again and went and sorted it.
When it arrived it was cold and it got even colder as they sent it up to us without any forks which isn't ideal for tackling scrambled eggs and beans.
When I called down for the forks I mentioned it would be rather cheeky of them for that breakfast to remain on the bill nonetheless it did, they obviously see that as satisfactory service.
This was room 1542, if they offer you this room in the guise of a ""suite"" do not accept it. It's a very narrow odd shaped room and the only decent thing about it is the terrace and the view which at night is brilliant.
Check in and check out both bang average.... I had no photo id on me at check in and so the guy made a big deal of it and basically tried to make out he was doing me a favour letting me stay there for the £450 I was paying for 2 nights.
On check out we weren't even asked how our stay was which is just as well really because I'd probably still be there now.
We were up on the top floor, with the room being so small and narrow we were obviously going to want to enjoy the terrace.... To do this you have to drag yourself down 15 floors again to fill out a form and get a key.... Because naturally they couldn't have mentioned this at check in!!",3.0,Underwhelmed is an understatement.,0,price,0

Oman,Superior Twin Room,1,February 2020,Group," I’ve booked for two separate beds.  But they gave me a room with a single bed.  I called them immediately to change  the room, they told me that they would send someone to separate the large bed for two separate beds, that was around 3:30 pm.  I went out after that and I came back at 10:30 pm, but they did not separate the bed, and the air conditioning was not working, which is another problem.  After several attempts to contact them, they sent room service to separate the bed.  After a while, the technician on air conditioning came and after examining, it became clear that there was a malfunction with air conditioning, and the room must be changed.

When I arrived they wanted to see photo ID (I'd stayed the week before, wasn't asked for then, I even have their loyalty card) which they then took away and copied (I presume).  I asked why - ""It's our policy for all booking.com customers"". I also said I wanted a receipt on departure. ""We can't give you one because you booked through booking.com"". I'd had the same problem last week and in the end emailed booking.com, who emailed Park Plaza, who emailed me a receipt.  What a waste of eveveryone's time!  So I persisted (""It's not our policy"") and said I had eventually got one from the previous week (""Well that's not how I've been trained"").  The Asst Manager came out.... ""It's not our policy, we can't do it because the rate you pay is different from our agreed price with booking.com"".  So I showed him last week's invoice - which showed exactly the same amount!  He grudgingly agreed they would provide one on departure (which they did).  Later I went to the bar to get something to eat.  The Maitre d' greeted me and told me to sit anywhere.  The one free table (for 2) was in the window, set for food, so I sat down.  Within 30 seconds he was back telling me I couldn't sit there, that was for the restaurant menu, I'd have to sit at the bar.  So I moved to the bar and he brought me the bar menu.  Then ignored me.  As did the other waiting staff.  I eventually spoke to a passing waitress..... ""I'll get one of the bar staff to take your order"".  Nothing.  Eventually after nearly half an hour I decided there were more deserving places to spend my money so I went to the burger bar under the railway arches down the road where the service was a million times better than this so-called 4-star hotel.

I then asked him if there was anywhere to tye up my bike and he actually rolled his eyes, laughed, sneered again and said he didnt know. (It was visible from where we were standing). The room was above average, but the cleaner did a rubbish job - removing dirty cups and glassses without replacing them. We went down to restaurant and were served food which was still partially frozen!!! We then had to wait 30mins to pay our bill.

United Kingdom,Superior Twin Room,2,January 2020,Group," There was a mix up with the booking that led to my teenage daughter being let into someone else’s room at 11pm at night, instead of just issuing another room, they kept us all waiting at reception for over 30 mins to sort why it had gone wrong despite my explanation that we had to be up at 4am to run an event.

United Kingdom,Superior Twin Room,1,January 2020,Couple," The bathroom wasn’t very clean it had some clumps of dust and hair that had been left on the floor. Just my preference but I like to see something out of a window rather than a similar building about 15 foot away, there was no chance of booking a preferred room and if necessary paying extra for it. We paid for the superior room to incorporate breakfast for an extra £25 as opposed to £22.50 each if you paid separately at the hotel, we found the breakfast awful!!! The bacon was congealed together and tasted very strange? There was also some insipid sausage along with some bland scrambled eggs, the hash brown was nice but the beans tasted of an inferior nature to a ‘standard’ type. There were only plates at the warm buffet so after queueing at the continental section, because the cooked breakfast was inedible, we had to go round again after fetching a plate because they didn’t have any there. We had to wait for ten minutes for one of the rare waiters to fetch a small jug to put milk in for our tea and coffee, when we did get some the coffee was like sludge and not very nice so went for the machine version and dutifully queued with 6 other guests for one o the machines whilst a similar number queued for the other machine, getting down the last two we were then told the machine had stopped working so had to join the back of the other queue!!! I decided to have a latte and a cappuccino but upon returning couldn’t taste any difference between the two as they were both really poor. My advice would be to not bother with breakfast as it was really bust and definitely not worth the wait, go out and find somewhere else. My last moan is we were unceremoniously woken at 03:45 in the morning by someone trying to get into the room opposite by tapping, banging, slapping and shouting to the occupant all to no avail, in the end I had to tell him to go down to reception to get them to attract the attention of whoever he was cohabiting with.

The room also wasn't really clean. Not dirty per se, but for that amount of money I expect more from a hotel. There was dust on the ceiling, lime in the shower and shower glass, tv furniture was actually broken.

We returned home after a long day at about 9.30pm and I checked with reception to see if the bed had been made! They said go up to your room and we will send housekeeping up with the bedding! We went up to room 1547 to find our keys didn’t work so rather than lug my 8 year old back downstairs my husband went down to tell reception! In the meantime housekeeping came to make up the bed! He used his key to get into room 1547 to find a man come to the door in his pants who said our luggage had been taken back down to concierge and this was now his room and his children were asleep! He said to me “you had Disney cases, they were taken back to concierge!” Julian the housekeeping manager heard all this and then took us back down to reception where another concierge man found our bags and said the guest in our room didn’t see our bags but he clearly had cos the guest told me I had Disney bags so he’d seen them! And we had valuables in the bags which if he wasn’t an honest person he could have taken our belongings including an iPad! 
We were now in reception with a very tired 8 year old with no room! The receptionist gave us a new room 1641 which we went all the way up to to find no bed for my little boy just a double bed and a table! This room was a smaller room than 1547 and no room to fit a bed! We rang down to reception to tell them and they kept saying we will send the bedding up! There was no bed to put the bedding on! Julian then arrived with said bedding and said he had no beds to fit in that room but he could squeeze a camp bed in! I went back down to reception to see if there was another room but they said they were fully booked!",1.0,Terrible,0,location,0

Aircondition wasnt heated the room. Desipite the asked for these The hotel recepcionist didnt solve the problem until the next day evening, the worst thing was Recepcionist didnt inform the other one for the problems and changed the room immediately, and the gym center and pool were just a joke which were my first demand to being  these in a hotel. And breakfast menu was unhealthy and venue was very dirty. They show me a table which was very dirty under and around.

United Kingdom,Executive Twin Room,2,September 2019,Family, The staff were unhelpful as many could not speak English and could not respond to simple queries. Our coffee machine was broken and took 2 days and 6 staff to sort it out. Quite noisy from other rooms. No door to the bathroom was unnerving to older companion. Decor is dark and lowly lit so difficult for older companion to move around. Facilities in room are controlled by electronic keypad and ok for younger people to master but older person struggled. I walked down the stairs one day and got chased by security guard asking what I was doing and should use the lift. I am scared of lifts and found this attitude intimidating. Will not stay here again.,6.2,Pleasant,0,staff,0

United States of America,Executive Double Room - River View,3,September 2019,Family, I did not like the fact that I had to take breakast everyday that we were at the hotel. I told the front desk that we were leaving early on the last day and did not want breakfast as I would eat at the airport. There were no wash cloths in the bathroom and had to ask twice for them. There were trays and empty bottles in the hallway to our room. We had a good view of the river and I feel that we paid for it. We could smell cigarette smoke in our room and I complained and nothing was done. Not bad for a non smoking room. The housekeeping staff could have done a better job of cleaning up the crumbs that were on the floor. I got a bill for 3 breakfast days but only had the chance to eat 2. This seems to be a great way to keep your restaurant going.,6.7,I expected more for the price we paid for the room.,0,food/drink,0

Also, they had removed our used towels but only replaced one of them. Beauty products weren't stocked up, used water glasses weren't replaced. The elevators are a disaster, there are only two of them and it takes ages for them to arrive and then again ages to get to the desired floor. Breakfast is to be taken in the bar at very low tables, and the range and quality is the poorest I have encountered so far. There was a bowl with grapefruit segments which were hardly recognisable as grapefruit, it was only a gooey mass. The air-conditioning in the room blows down straight onto the face, so we had to have it switched off at night.

United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,2,April 2019,Couple," Overall trip was a disaster. Check in process was ok, however we were pointed towards the wrong set of elevators. We spent a good 3 mins trying to find the room. During this time we asked for directions to our room from the housekeeping personnel that were around. The first 2 spoke zero english, she kept talking to us in spanish i believe. Finally a male member of staff was able to assist, pointing us in the right direction. Upon entering our room, we noticed that bathroom had not been cleaned. Towels & toiletries were changed , however there were multiple stains on the floor and the wall just by the toilet (looked like piss). The carpet was not hoovered (bits of food) and the hard floor had foot prints and dirty marks. We called reception and was told someone would come up. The lady who came up told us that the ?pee (stains) could not be cleaned, she did not acknowledge the dirty carpet & hard floor despite us pointing it out, she was incredibly rude and not at all professional. We went downstairs to complain, only to be told that house keeping would clean the room in an hour or 2. We asked for a room change which fortunately they agreed to. Suffice to say it was evident that the cleanliness and attention to detail was incredibly lacking for this hotel coz the 2nd room was clearly not well cleaned either (although the bathroom was better, no pee stains). Day 2 of our stay, we woke up to a cold room with the ac blowing cold air despite being set at the max of 28C. I rang reception and an engineer came up. He fiddled with the ac for about 30mins following which he said if it doesnt get warm in 10mins then it would be a ""big job"". Reception rang after to check if the issue had been resolved and after a long chat it was decided that we would be given a heater. 2 hrs later, housekeeping brought us a kettle😣! By this point we had given up all hope of a nice weekend getaway.",3.8,Poor,0,staff,0

United Kingdom,Suite - River View,2,March 2019,Couple," Never ever left a bad review about a hotel but honestly this has got to be the worst hotel experience I've had. We got to the hotel excited to stay there. At the check in desk we were greeted by a the assistant. Who then typed something into the computer, then disappeared into the back for a good 10 minutes. Came out, checked us in. We proceeded to our room. Put the key in the door and shortly realised that someone else was already in the room. Personal belongings were everywhere. We went back down to the reception, explained what had happened and we were given a new room. The hotel was actually alright but that initial wrong room situation had got our backs up a little bit. So when we checked out, a day later we realised that the hotel had over charged us an extra £100. So we then had to go all the way back to the hotel to get a refund. The lady who dealt with us wasn't at all apologetic  or remorseful. Looks great but I'd never stay there again.",5.8,Worst customer experience ever!,0,staff,0

website advised that a small deposit would guarantee the booking. 2 days

disappointed with the service and the complementary surprise. There was
no hair dryer in the room, which I find very strange, even the most
basic hotels have these facilities. They got the bill at the end of
their stay, which had £145.00 added for using the mini bar. They never
took anything from the mini bar. This was a clerical error. For being a
very favourable hotel, there was no bathrobes or slippers either. I have
my husbands mum and dad going this weekend. I'm not looking forward
to their feedback after their stay. I would not recommend this sister

You in fact took £100 which was processed and taken from my account. Why was this done when the bill was already paid and no damages or outstanding items where incurred. We requested an upgrade and was told that it was not available. We heard another member of staff asking someone else if they wanted to upgrade. When I rang the hotel on 26/02/2019 about the £100 being taken from my account I was promised a call back.

United Kingdom,Executive Double Room - River View,3,February 2019,Solo traveler," I had arrived at the hotel at around 16:30 after a very gruelling almost 14hr long haul flight and all I wanted to do was get some sleep. Even though im a Radisson Gold card holder I had to wait for almost 20 mins to get to the check-in desk at reception only to find that the room, which was supposed to be ready to check-in to at 14:00 was not ready and was informed by the staff I would have to wait for 1 - 2 hours before the room was ready for me. At that point I was so tired that I could barely keep my eyes open and the only thing that was offered to me is the reception staff told me they would keep my luggage for me while I waited. Ive just gotten off a very long flight I was exhausted, where was I supposed to wait, was I expected to sit in a seat in the lobby or aimlessly walk round London exhausted while they prepared my room. Id booked a room with a river view and in the end I ended up having to stay in a lesser priced room with no river view and the bathroom smelled as if it hadn't been cleaned properly. The apology I received, at reception for this was hardy convincing. The following morning I discovered the the reason why the room hadn't been ready, the previous day, when I left my room for work, ensuring the ""please clean my room light was illuminated"" the cleaning staff where stood in the corridor less than four rooms away gossiping. I arrived back after being away for over three hours and the room hadn't been clean. I was still suffering from jet lag so I just went to my room so I could sleep again. I later phoned reception to ask for some fresh towels, I've now checked out of the room, three days have gone by and im still waiting for those towels. Ive stayed in the hotel numerous times and never had a problem before but I can assure you I will think very strongly about staying there again. I dont know what has happened to the service in the hotel but it has plummeted from scoring a 10, in my eyes, to dow near a 0.",5.4,Riverbank Park Plaza really dropped the ball,0,bed,0

United Kingdom,Executive Double Room,2,December 2018,Couple," It seemed like we weren't getting paid no attention when we requested a few things, especially from room service! We had to request slippers, a bath robe as we only got given one in room and other little things which resulted in them taking over half an hour each time! We tried to check in around 10-11AM as I stated we would be quite early, I understand this is subject to availability but it just would have been nice as I requested it like a month ago. When we came back around 3PM we checked into our room, however the bathroom door would not shut at all! We were confused as to how the house keeping didn't notice this when cleaning / servicing the room? It must have been noticed as it was stuck and wouldn't even slide half way! Or maybe it was noticed but they just didn't think people would care?! Very awkward if you would go to the toilet with the door wide open if you ask me! We rung up reception about this and stated someone either needs to fix it or we will have to move rooms (as we had plans for the afternoon) we didn't want it to waste our time. 40 Minutes and 4 phone calls later - a maintenance guy finally decided to arrive!

United Kingdom,Executive Double Room,2,December 2018,Couple," It seemed like we weren't getting paid no attention when we requested a few things, especially from room service! We had to request slippers, a bath robe as we only got given one in room and other little things which resulted in them taking over half an hour each time! We tried to check in around 10-11AM as I stated we would be quite early, I understand this is subject to availability but it just would have been nice as I requested it like a month ago. When we came back around 3PM we checked into our room, however the bathroom door would not shut at all! We were confused as to how the house keeping didn't notice this when cleaning / servicing the room? It must have been noticed as it was stuck and wouldn't even slide half way! Or maybe it was noticed but they just didn't think people would care?! Very awkward if you would go to the toilet with the door wide open if you ask me!
