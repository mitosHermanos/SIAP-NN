The evening took a turn when my partner became unwell with chest pain and we had to call an ambulance to the hotel, we informed staff of the situation and they were very attentive and helpful during a worrying time, the night manager (Tom I think?) came to us and introduced himself, he was very kind and let us know to contact him if we needed anything. The staff brought my partner water and eventually we were able to head up to our room after the drama.
Besides this, we had such a comfortable stay, the room was spotless, the staff were very friendly and professional.  The customer care and whole experience was second to none.

Ireland,Superior Room,4,July 2019,Solo traveler," The property could not be in a better location. Perfect for restaurants, sites etc. could not be more perfect. The rooms were spotless. I was at the front of the hotel looking into the Main Street and it was completely silent in my room . It is a very comfortable room with modern amenities and everything you would need. The tv was huge as was the bed and I liked the large comfy couch and desk. The bathroom was also huge. It is a great hotel. A bit pricey but worth the money. You cannot go wrong staying here. The breakfast was excellent and I had a fresh made cooked omelet everyday I was there. It was gorgeous. The buffet has everything anyone would want from fruit to pancakes to eggs bacon and sausage,fruit juices and every bread imaginable. An excellent buffet. Would I say here again?

The staff were so helpful and I had a great time.  It is the best of the various Radisson Blu hotels I have stayed in, in terms of facilities, staff helpfulness and comfort.",10.0,This is a really lovely hotel whose staff go out of their way to be helpful and friendly.,1,comfort,0

Australia,Royal Mile Suite,2,September 2018,Couple," First, the check-in staff were very good. We arrived very early and our room wasn't ready so they looked after our bags, organised some refreshments and arranged a tour for us. Similarly, when we needed a last minute dinner booking for Saturday night, concierge was able to recommend a very good restaurant and arrange a table for us. Thank you Kenneth!
The suite was gigantic with a separate lounge room and dining area. Bedroom was large also. Only point I'd make is they could have cut down on space in the hallway or lounge room to make the bathroom bigger - bit of a squeeze for two people simultaneously. Bed was very comfortable and linen nice and cosy for cold nights in Edinburgh!
The bar staff were friendly and hospitable with a good selection of drinks. The decor and appearance of the hotel are gorgeous and totally in keeping with the old town Royal Mile.

Australia,Superior Room,3,January 2020,Family," Location is brilliant, central yet calm, ok decor. Downstairs area for guests to sit and wait is great. Simon, the operations manager, despite his young age was very professional, energetic, smart and had outstanding listening skills and got the job done most efficiently.
He would make an outstanding hotel manager in my opinion and could be seen running everywhere 'putting out fires' due to limited staffing, I suspect.  Reckon should be poached by 5 star with more funds and better staff schedule mgt (here resources too low to do this well). Pool area is good. Spa is outsourced and has friendly personnel and good treatments. 
Bed was very comfortable and had good bedding. New room after cleaning mishap was clean and comfy and all our things were moved by them at my request so our day could keep going withoit further hassle. Check out time was flexible (12pm to 1pm) which was great for late departures/ later plane. Reception staff overall professional, responsive and doing their best. Female manager ok, but seemed just a good receptionist, not an energetic decision maker.

Australia,Superior Room,3,January 2020,Family," Location is brilliant, central yet calm, ok decor. Downstairs area for guests to sit and wait is great. Simon, the operations manager, despite his young age was very professional, energetic, smart and had outstanding listening skills and got the job done most efficiently.
He would make an outstanding hotel manager in my opinion and could be seen running everywhere 'putting out fires' due to limited staffing, I suspect.  Reckon should be poached by 5 star with more funds and better staff schedule mgt (here resources too low to do this well). Pool area is good. Spa is outsourced and has friendly personnel and good treatments.

United Kingdom,Standard Room,1,October 2018,Family," Sadly our stay was not as memorable as it should be due to a fire drill during the night where the fire evacuation process was very poor. There were no correct evacuation process, no fire wardens on sight when we had to evacuate. I had to wake my young children and have to go down 6 flight of stairs into the freezing cold in the middle of the night. The most disturbing thing is that the fire alarm was triggered by someone smoking on site. To our disappointment, the hotel did not take into account the distress me and my young children had to face in the middle of the night out, having to risk going down these stairs while children were half asleep into the freezing cold, extremely frightened. The hotel took no responsibility to the distress and discomfort caused to my young children. 
We tried to ask for a refund for the distress and disturbance caused. The reason I am writing this review is not that of the false alarm and but the hotel management did not seem to be too concerned about our ordeal we faced or the fact the incidence could have cost us our lives.",5.8,Okay,1,location,1

I don’t think it’s fair to colour the reputation of the hotel based on this one aspect, the staff overall were brilliant and the breakfast buffet items were great but the service at breakfast was the only issue I had. The restaurant as a whole, the food when we did get it was excellent.

United Kingdom,Superior Room,2,September 2020,Couple, Cleanliness and housekeeping. Honeymoon weekend having just got married during Covid crisis. You would think cleanliness would be a priority. Booked a superior room. Was told it had been cleaned and was ready. Checked in and went to room. Having a look around as you do. Someone’s old dirty top was on the floor behind one of the chairs! Obviously not a thorough clean! I hat else hadn’t they checked or cleaned! Complained and moved rooms. Next day went out and again room was supposedly cleaned while we were out. However they had failed to change the pillowcases because it was still covered in make up from the night before! If they hadn’t changed those this meant they hadn’t changed the sheets at all as the pillow was on top. I go home also means they probably hadn’t cleaned the room again. The rooms are not cheap and this is supposed to be a quality hotel but housekeeping t had let you down twice. How can anyone be sure they are safe in your hotel In Times or Covid. I have emailed the company twice and had no response. Once while still there!! Very disappointed and put a dampener on the oi mi I honeymoon. It had been a stressful enough week with getting married and cancelled reception meaning hardly any family due to Covid. We did not have the luxury of postponing. We treated our selves to this break in o give us a good start to married life.

We appreciate that soft furnishings have had to be removed, but the advertised minibar was completely empty for no apparent reason. And the thick dust on the back of the couches is inexcusable.

I checked out and had forgotten my suit and shoes in the room. I returned a couple of hours later (same day) to collect it and was told that housekeeping couldn’t find it and so I had to fly home without it even though I knew it must of been in the building. Front of house hotel staff dealt with this matter appallingly - one member of staff even rolled her eyes and huffed and puffed at us when we said it was urgent as we had to catch a flight.
The hotel manager then stepped in and in all fairness was excellent, reassured us which was all you want as a paying customer. He said he would send me the suit when they found it (who knows how they couldn’t find it to start with being a hotel of their calibre) but anyway we left reassured we would be sent it if/ when it “showed up”.
Next day I received a call to say that they had located it and housekeeping had “put it to the side and gone home” as opposed to correctly logging it onto a system and putting it in lost property. Anyway they had my suit so that was some good news, until they tried to charge me £20-30 to post it back to me. After a stern conversation with the manager about my experience he called back to say he would send it for free. I am grateful for this but the whole thing had already ruined my stay and I won’t be returning to a Radisson group hotel again.

Australia,Superior Room,3,January 2020,Family," I found the place a little understaffed in the cleaning department. The second floor was disappointing, but the fifth floor was great.  I didn't like one of the male back office managers tell Stefano, one of the receptionists, off in front of guests. Very unprofessional image and putting bad atmosphere into the hotel.
Also bringing luggage up was a favour as portrayed by the tone of Stefano, so that we carried our own luggage up, which does not scream 5 star. Insisting on having luggage brought down at the end of the stay took 2 phone calls to reception and one to concierge and 30 min....Concierge only there during the day. Breakfast had lots of choices but was made up of cheap options and had nothing homemade/any local specialities.
Felt like Aldi food without the organic options. No cakes.
No walk in showers. Baths need updating. No drinks were free, not even water bottles in the room...no welcome chocolate or flowers...no personalised note...no minibar....no downturn service. Big push to become a Radisson member and getting points only if not going via booking.com. Getting room service on top of prices that were about x4 also required a delivery fee!

United Kingdom,Superior Room,1,December 2018,Couple," Paid £260 for one night we went to check in and told our room wasn't ready but should be ready in an hour so we went back in an hour and told it still wasn't ready then went back again and told to wait another 20 minutes. As it was Christmas market time there wasn't anywhere to sit in whilst we waited as most places were too busy to get a seat. So we were left just walking about. I have something wrong with my stomach so this wasn't ideal at all as I was in alot of pain that day and was struggling. 
We finally got checked in and there wasn't even an apology or that for our wait. Prior to us coming I emailed asking to put balloon and that in room (paid extra) for my partners birthday and they said was ok for that to happen but didn't at all.

United Kingdom,Standard Room,1,October 2018,Couple," We booked this hotel stay to celebrate a milestone wedding anniversary. When using the pool/sauna facilities, the staff were rather ignorant and unhelpful when I pointed out that there was no water available and that there were piles of empty cups left around. This made me question the cleanliness of the area as obviously no-one was checking to refill the water or clean up. Similarly in the dining area for breakfast, the staff were not particularly attentive. Our table had no milk on for our coffees and when I pointed this out to a staff member he just moodily placed one in front of me. The dining area itself is incredibly tight, with very little space between each table. I felt like we were dining with a group of other people as they were so close together! Simple things like tables spread out more and tablecloths on the tables would have made the place much nicer. I also thought the room was a let down to what was pictured prior to booking - just a plain white bedsheet hastily made, no bed runner on which I thought made the rooms look appealing in the pictures. We had told them of our anniversary prior to our stay and we did have someone come to our room with a card and gift, which was a nice gesture. However the card was just addressed to myself (not the both of us - then saying Happy Anniversary - which obviously means two people are involved) and handed us one little bag with fudge in and one drinks voucher. Gave me another fudge bag when saw 2 of us. Considering it's obviously for an anniversary it would be common sense to provide two drinks vouchers so that as a couple we could enjoy our drink together. As a manager previously, I thought this just showed little thought in the actual gesture itself as there is no point providing one gesture when the celebration is obviously for two people. Overall I thought the hotel let itself down and didn't meet my expectations, which for an anniversary celebration, is sad.",6.2,"Didn't meet standards - room a disappointment, moody staff and cramped dining area.",0,fitness,0

United Kingdom,Royal Mile Suite,1,October 2018,Couple," After checking in at approximately 3pm, we left our room for some shopping. Upon our return it became obvious that someone had been in our room as there were some minor changes to the suite. Bedsheets had been adjusted and all of the curtains had been drawn, this wouldn’t prove to be an issue however when you know you are in possession of a number of valuables I didn’t appreciate this. 
Further to this, and more annoyingly, at approximately 12am the fire alarm began to ring out, we very quickly left the room to discover a minor state of panic amongst other guests. Of course as a health and safety procedure this wouldn’t be an issue, but what was a concern was the fact that there was no sign of any staff members in order to better organise the panic of the situation. We headed outside only to be ushered round the corner by a staff member on a cigarette break. There was no attempt to head count/ensure that everyone was evacuated and then later accounted for upon returning into the building. There was a considerate lack of communication regarding what had caused the alarm, and what the resolution had been. This is concerning given the presence of two fire engines.
The following morning we received a knock on the door to fill up the mini bar for the next guests, despite us requesting a late check out. At this point we were still getting ready for the day. 
Lastly, the light on the side of the wardrobe (above the kettle) was flickering throughout the night despite being switched off which prevented a good nights sleep.",5.8,Didn’t meet expectations,0,staff,0
