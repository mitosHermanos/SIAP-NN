The room was lovely with a gorgeous view of the London Eye and they made the extra effort to include balloons for a birthday which was lovely."," Although the rest of the stay was perfect, breakfast does let the hotel down, maybe we just caught it on a bad day? The staff were very unintentive and unhelpful due to us having to ask what we had to do to order breakfast as we were ignored. The breakfast itself arrived to actually have a good few items missing that we did order which again we had to go find someone to ask for the missing products. The cooked breakfast was nothing amazing, dried up bacon, dried up mushrooms, cold beans as though it had been sat for hours when you would think for the money it would be cooked fresh so I don't think the breakfast was value for money and definitely wasn't the best start to my boyfriends birthday that I had in mind.",8.3,Birthday Weekend

The layout of the room was quite odd too it’s a big room but having the bathroom / wardrobe in the middle made it feel tiny and the bed area is small and the sofa area is kind of pushed to the back with no natural light so probably doesn’t get used. I had higher expectations to be honest, considering the price. Kind of felt like I could have had a more luxury room at a budget hotel, just not the view.

I liked the huge windows and views of the city. Lovely view of Big Ben from the main restaurant. Definitely there will be another visit!"," - The breakfast was tasteless. We go to the breakfast room only for coffee or tea. We understand that might be because of the necessary precaution due to COVID-19.
- Also, when we checked out, the concierge was talking to us in an aggressive way for no reason! When he (David) came to our room he said 'If I knew you have heavy luggages I would not come!' and he continues with his aggressive responses. However, the taxi driver explained that to us that the concierge wants to give him a tip and this is a common way to ask for a tip! Anyway, I had a flight I need to catch so I have not got the time to make a complaint. However, that was annoying!",10,Highly Recommended

447,United Kingdom,Studio King (Family),1 night ,October 2020,Couple, It was a romantic stay for my boyfriend. When checking in I had a very helpful Asian woman I wish I remembered her name to mention her to her manager! However checking out wasn’t so good. Anyways I only booked for the one night I wish I booked for longer. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay. We will definitely be coming back again to stay longer.," First of all the Tv volume is very low, even at the highest volume. Second of all the shower would go on and off and I’m use to long steaming hot showers. Finally checking out was not what I expected. I had asked for a later check out time which was complementary. My boyfriend and I left for lunch and came back around 1. We were locked out. We went down to ask the receptionist what was going on she said it was because we were meant to check out. Her attitude towards us was awful I wish I took her name and complained. Yesterday when she was checking in a white couple her attitude was so much better. It’s a shame. Anyways she gave us a new card and I asked her if she needed the old ones and she just shaked her head. I could tell she didn’t want to talk to us. Going to check out later on she had the same attitude I didn’t want to go to her so I lined up to go to the same person that checked me in. She then came out and asked to check me out. She didn’t ask about my stay or nothing she just asked us to hand her the cards then we left. I really was unimpressed.",9.0,Surprise visit for my boyfriend

As I travel to London a lot, I was going to use this hotel every time I came back but I have changed my mind. We had 2 rooms as there are 5 members of my family, 1 room was fine, it was clean. Then the other was extremely disappointing, no hygiene seals like there usually is, crumpled rubbish on the bed, claw marks/scratches and smear marks all over the headboard. Staff were really helpful and moved us to an upgraded room but the only let down is that they moved us from a superior room with a super king size bed to a room with a seating area and a regular sized bed. I was very grateful but I had chosen the large bed for a reason and I would have preferred to be put into a room with the same size bed. Do not want to risk being put into another room where who knows what had happened, that room really should be closed off and have the headboard replaced.",7.0,Claw and smear marks on headboard!

A minor irritation is that I could not have my Ubereats takeaway delivered to my room either by the driver or a member of staff. I had £5 on my desk ready as a tip. I tried to order breakfast using the QR code on the TV and every time I attempted to select my breakfast it stated something about ""price and VAT not being loaded"" or a similar expression.

The extra selection  of TV channels was appreciated as this is often disappointing within another hotels. Great bathroom, great water pressure providing a wonderful  shower. 
Ice machine located in corridor was very much appreciated."," As with any  hotel breakfast  service is the first opportunity of the day to wow your customer and set first impressions of the day. Unfortunately you did not achieve  this, ease take my criticism  as constructive on the following  points:
The welcome was far to casual and upon confirming and we have not been there before we were still not sat to a table or giving an explanation of service. 
The breakfast  buffet layout was uninnovative and slightly  boring with the layout with 3 service assistants all unaware in the correct terminology of addressing customers in English within the catering service industry. 
As for the food I was very disappointed that all the bacon was extremely  overcooked and the eggs were the liquid variety and not natural and the taste in this is extremely  noticeable and for somebody like myself who values a traditional  hot English breakfast I was extremely  upset with what I received, there was no toast available and only upon my exit did I notice the toaster was in a separate dinning area, you provided small  bowls of precut fruit as a yogurt topper but no yogurt was available and to finish off the coffe machine calibration to the size of your coffe mug does not fill to the top level which added to the all the small detail missed by you that affects the service level which is expected from such a well known  brand and beautiful  building. 
At no point during the hour spent at the breakfast  table did anybody complete a service check, speak to me or clear used items pushed aside from my table but the staff seemed very focused of clearing tables when customers  vacated .",9.0,Wonderful

Also i stayed 2 nights extending my stay to 3 nights in total and the first 2 nights the cleaners didn't come to clean I had to call reception.
Also on our extended night the cleaner just burst into our room and asked why are we still here? to be honest we just laughed it off but i do feel like they should communicate with their staff as we could of been changing or anything!",8.0,who said you cant be from London and have a perfect holiday in London.

Special thanks to Marc (if I remember correctly...he had long hair middle parted). He checked us in...excellent mannerism and very polite which was more apparent after I could hear the lady checking in customers next to me. So thanks to him"," The sofa bed was OK however all night I was a little concerned for my young daughters who tend to roll around a lot in their sleep. the frame of the sofa bed was extremely hard and very easy for them to hurt themselves. I had to use our extra pillows to pad it up. And couldn't let them sleep on our bed due to the risk of them falling off the bed as it was higher. 
In the Morning ordered pancakes with chocolate sauce...it cost £9 for four tiny pancakes which was like something out of a packet from asdas for a quid...oh and with 3 tiny tubs of Nutella...I understand the extortionate price as its park plaza but the food should be worth it. The egg/dairy free pancakes that i brought from home for my kids tasted better and I ended up eating theirs as I was still hungry after the tiny portion I was given.",8.0,Park plaza Westminster bridge

From when you walk in the room there is Lots of assurance about the room being sanitized and you can tell a lot of care is being taken with regards to cleanliness and keeping guests safe!
Check in was very smooth and the lady at the desk was friendly.
The Chromecast enabled tv was a nice bonus and you had all info on the tv too including menus and other info.
Digital control of lights also quite cool and simple to use.
Location wise this place is great, abundance of taxis outside and buses close by, and we stumbled across some restaurants close by as well and a starbucks right across from the hotel and little newsagents shop close by as well.
Didn't use the hotel parking but Waterloo car parks is literally 3mins walk away and really nice that the hotel's website advertises this as it is much cheaper.

After staying in a different hotel last week and facing a few 'challenges' -It was reassuring to see how well some hotels are coping with the issues and challenges of the recent pandemic. 
It felt safe and clean. Well managed safety procedures and protocols. Great to see a company thinking things through and implementing what seems to be the best measures in regard to covid-19.
Fantastic breakfast delivered to the room (Those sausages.... wow).  Incredibly prompt and good value room service for evening food and drink in the room.
It pleases me to say; probably the most courteous and aware hotel staff I've encountered. And surely 'double points' for being understandably stretched/maybe under staffed due to the current ever present covid situation. 
A hotel that is a credit to the great city, which glowed panoramically when viewed from my fantasic comfortable room.

1265,United Kingdom,Studio King (Family),3 nights ,August 2020,Family," We stayed here for three nights during August and had a terrific stay. The hotel is situated in a perfect central location and easily accessible. Our check in was swift and easy. The room was clean and we were able to request anything we needed throughout our stay. We also ordered room service which was also very good. 
The breakfast was excellent, the hotel has created a system to ensure that you can still enjoy a full buffet breakfast. This did involve them plating it up for you and a few minutes of queuing, but that wasn’t an issue at all. However the only issue we had was that some other guests still seem confused as to why the staff would have to serve it this way, why there are screens in place and didn’t seem to grasp why you would need all of these precautions. Top marks to the staff for dealing with some pretty idiotic questions during the service! 
Also wanted to highlight how superb the security and concierge staff were at this hotel. We were driving with our baby son and we had a lot of bags with us, which they helped us with considerably. There is also limited parking outside of the hotel and the staff ensured we had a spot and generally made our arrival and departure incredibly easy.

The room was lovely, my children loved the cookies and strawberries set up in the room.  Having a small kitchen area is ideal, so we could keep drinks in the fridge.  Also having two separate sleeping areas works really well for us.  My only complaint is our shower leaked despite the door being closed.
Breakfast was included so one morning we had in our room, couldn't fault the service.  The next morning we went downstairs, the selection available is excellent.  
The concierge service is brilliant, we were able to leave our luggage the morning we checked out so we didn't have to carry it around with us.
The facilties and management in place regarding covid was excellent.  Automatic temperature checks as you walk in.  Seperate entrance and exits.  Well spaced tables at breakfast.  Masks worn in public areas and plenty of hand sanitisers everywhere.
Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",,9.0,Wonderful

1277,United Kingdom,Studio King (Family),2 nights ,August 2020,Family, It’s a stylish hotel and the stay would have been better if it wasn’t for Coronavirus restrictions that had been implemented which made no sense to me. For example guests could eat in the hotel bar but not in the restaurant. There were clearly enough guests to open the restaurant & I’m sure this would have been safer than having a large cue of people wanting to get in as well as the bar area being very full.," Cleaning staff barging in the room wanting to know when we were checking out, even though we had arranged a later check out.
Cleaning staff dressed like ordinary people who didn’t understand the words ‘can I see your ID’ - to me they could have been anyone.
Room service didn’t know where our room was either......and when we didn’t answer the door they became quite frustrated on the phone. When they eventually realised after going to the wrong room twice there was no apology.",7.0,Staff didn’t know where our room was!

1279,United Kingdom,Studio King (Family),2 nights ,August 2020,Family, The bar was a lovely chill area and masks were mandatory. The beds were comfortable and the bar food was good and the service in the bar was good., Our room was dirty the coffee station was not cleaned and the mini fridge had stains from previous use. The shower cubicle has some mould in it. The glass  furniture was a bit dusty. I’m not sure with lockdown and being busy could have led to this being missed and it took a several attempts and speaking to guest services and a cleaner and then going downstairs to get it cleaned. All we got was a bottle of wine to say thank you for staying with us  but would have been happier with a manger or someone speaking to us regarding the matter.,7.0,Pleasant stay

1282,United Kingdom,Studio King (Family),3 nights ,August 2020,Family," Clean, modern, incredible location. Late checkout of 12 noon and you could extend that for a fee, and early check in of 2pm. They get a big thumbs up for that. Well soundproofed, I heard nothing and we were facing both Waterloo station and St Thomas’s hospital. Excellent blackout curtains. Good view from the upper floors though you need to pay extra for a view of the river/Parliament/London Eye. Great transport links. Nice design, very stylish.  Good modern TVs with a good range of channels including Sky sports and movies, you could also Chromecast to them. Fast free WiFi. For doing London as a tourist it’s great."," Everything closed facilities wise due to Covid... given my home gym and pool are open I’m not sure why they were closed (until October apparently). The bed wasn’t very comfortable (I’ve had much better) and the sofa bed was very uncomfortable, maybe ok for smaller kids. No housekeeping visit so no tea/coffee restock. No plug sockets or USB by the bed. And a member off staff let herself into the room without knocking on the morning of checkout. Very unprofessional.",7.0,"Modern hotel, amazing location."

Cot for baby was set up quickly following our arrival. Microwave and fridge in the room. Kettle, tea and coffee. Large wardrobe with iron and ironing board. 
Breakfast was great, good variety and decent quality - went down for the buffet the first night and ordered up the second. Would recommend breakfast in the room! Social distancing measures in the restaurant were good but meant long queues and seating areas were busy, so we really enjoyed our breakfast the following day in a more relaxed atmosphere. Requested the room to be cleaned and within half an hour, friendly housekeepers came round and did a brilliant job. They otherwise clean every three days."," Facilities (spa, swimming pool and gym) still closed despite other hotels having opened them up again per government guidance.

Room great, bed awesome and very clean. However, check in was slow and our room was not ready until late and no apolopgy offered. The facilities were limited. The gym and pool was understandably closed due to Covid19 but also the bar and some restaurants were shut which made no sense.
Instead of crockery in the room we had 2 paper coffee cups which we had no choice but to refuse. The room was only cleaned on request, again understandably due to covid, but surely replenishing toiletries and refreshments daily is relatively straight forward and risk free. Again we had to request this and the products replaced were limited. 
So not the 5/5 it was last time we stayed. Reception staff were also not very friendly, they seemed stressed.",8.0,Let down post covid

After returning to reception we were allocated a room on the 3rd floor (where we were initially on the 12th floor). Returned to reception to complain as the promised view was inadequate for the additional money spent for a special occasion. We were told an additional wait time would be necessary to clean a room on a higher floor. After three hours we still hadn’t been contacted by the hotel as promised but on return found the room was in fact ready. Poor service and very little apology from the hotel staff. Very disappointing start to our stay after a long journey - didn’t feel like 5 star service.,7.0,Good quality hotel in excellent location dampened by distress over the check in experience

1551,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room with Internal View,1 night ,August 2020,Solo traveler," Aside from that I had a great time their, but all in all I paid £146 for a £96 pound booking, that’s including the £50 deposit which shall not be returned due to the unwanted pop I had drank due to thirst. 
I would go again but I would say to bring your own stuff and not have anything out the room, it may also be better when the facilities are available but they handled the social distancing really well due to it being extremely packed. The staff was still calm and approachable. Maybe suggest having less booking during this time as it was nearly impossible to social distance when everyone was checking in and out at the same time. All in all I hope we are all safe from the virus as people wasn’t social distancing in the lifts either :("," Not keen on the purchase of this hotel, only for the fact that there are a lot of hidden charges they don’t tell you about. It’s the fine print but it’s should be in BOLD. The £50 deposit wasn’t relayed to me until I got there, this is not clearly found on their site so be careful. Also there was sweets/drinks in the fridge, nowhere did it say you have to pay or had any  prices.. which meant I lost most of my deposit based on that. 
I’m not saying the hotel. The staff are polite and it’s very clean, perfect location BUT the hidden charges are unecessary and I believe the staff should make customers aware when they check in (I.e list of prices for the items in the room). It’s very easy to believe it’s free when you have wine, cans of pops, sweets just sitting in your hotel room without requesting it and no price list! Ironically when I checked out they had a price list at their desk so I would ask for that first! Also the £50 deposit should be written in BOLD not fine print. I believe it’s a great hotel but very money hungry, they wasn’t really concerned with my finances and the deposit takes a few days to go back in your account (not given an exact day) which shows me they care more about the money and will charge customers with hidden charges at last minute if you are not careful. Imagine if I didn’t have the extra money!",7.0,Good

1586,United Kingdom,Studio King (Family),3 nights ,August 2020,Family," This is a lovely hotel near to the Houses of Parliament and the South Bank. 
Was only intending to stay for 3 nights but extended it to 4 as the kids didn’t want to go home as we found loads nearby for them to do. 
The room was lovely, kids (5&3) stayed in the Living room on the sofa bed which they loved as they also had their own TV, The bed in the Bedroom was really comfortable. We made 3 requests, a few more pillows, arrived in 10mins. More loo roll same again and for the room to be clean which it was by the time we got back, so could’t fault anything really. (Room cleaning currently reduced due to COVID-19, but they will clean it on request) 
We were also lucky enough to see Shrek visiting the hotel which made the kids day as they then thought he was staying at the hotel too (Which of course he was..)Highly recommend the Shrek Adventure if staying with little ones, it’s a little bit pricey but worth the money. If your looking for things to do for Free, the Princess Diana Memorial Playground at Kensington Palace is well worth a visit. As is Archbishop's Park which is a few minutes walk from the hotel

Some of the staff serving food were not wearing masks neither we’re mosts guest -who weren’t following social distancing either. The hotels thermal scanner was not working /functioning at entrance as advertised. We were lucky we left the Saturday or else it would have been too crowded for us to stay during a pandemic. Our check in was delayed the lady at the desk insisted I didn’t have a confirmed room with a view even though I had an email confirmation and had even been told over phone that we had a room with a london eye view. Eventually we got our room - london eye view at the 8th floor studio king was ok- we had a way better view from a room in a budget hotel last year.  The house keeping /staff who came to then set up the baby cot and sofa bed was very rude. He set up the sofa bed but clearly had no clue how to set up the cot - eventually someone else set it up. He was rude because I told him there was dust on the table - in his words ‘thats not my fault’.

However we were kept updated and were well compensated, for the inconvenience. Which was dealt with by Caroline, who is a credit to your organisation. Albeit being a  disappointment that the Spa, gym and relaxation areas were closed, due to COVID 19 restrictions. This didn’t dampen our stay. Therefore we will be returning 
to the Park Plaza very soon and conveying to family, friends and colleagues alike. That for a home away from home with superior human service, and fabulous calm surroundings there is no better place.

Found dust in bathroom and main room, on the sides, all on the glass tops, tv, bed side tables. Marks on the door. Not what id expected from such a hotel.

The room service food was delicious and good quality., A minor issue was that the sofa bed was down and I had to put it away. This involved moving a heavy mattress and folding away the sofa bed which was less than ideal. I didn't want to bother the staff. I did find the staff slightly 'stand-offish' and not so friendly.

All of the staff were super professional and friendly over the two days when we had to use different services - they should be proud of their customer service!"," Just the breakfast was a bit bog standard and for the price didn't represent particularly good value for money.

This was made harder by the fact the phone in our room wasn't working. We were also surprised to see the spa full of screaming, very young children.

1841,Israel,Superior Double Room with Internal View,2 nights ,February 2020,Group," Location was very central, few minutes walk to the Waterloo station, with a convenient Taxi stop at the hotel's doorstep.
Rooms were new, modern and comfortable. Housekeeping staff were very professional and effective. Felt a bit weird that after 23:00 guests were asked to show their room key to the security in order to enter the hotel, but I guess that's out of security reasons and they were extremely friendly so it was no harm.
Breakfast was kind of nice but with a bit limited choice, though for the price charged, you'd suppose that omelette would be included, but surprisingly, it's not. It was for an extra charge (though the pouffe included scrambled and boiled eggs for free.
Breakfast also included a good coffee machine, with disposable cups which was nice addition for us smokers.  
If you take a room with a river view, I guess the views would have been spectacular, but my window faced an interior wall, so I can't really judge on that.
Wi-fi was excellent and needed no password, but once you step out of the hotel's entrance there was no signal."," 1. After a long travel, the least you'd expect from the hotel, is a complimentary water at the room - but it wasn't there! I guess this policy makes the hotel a few more pennies a day, but it's outrageous to my opinion!..
2. For the price paid, omelettes at breakfast should be included in the price.
3. We had 4 rooms under the same reservation, and though check-in took about 15 minutes, but after the long travel we had it felt like ages. I've been to hotels before, and I understand the hotel's need to have somekind of a guarantee, but I think it's more than enough to fill a single application for the 4 of us and our offer to take the security deposit for all the rooms at once wasn't really complicated. I don't blame the receptionist, but I do blame the management for failing in this small point.
4. At the hotel bar, we encountered a rude waiter. We opened a table with a big tab, but when one of our group had a drink from outside and asked for Ice he was rudely answered that his drink is not from the hotel's bar and that he can't serve him Ice, though everything else on the table was ordered from there!.. 
5. Wi-Fi reception was extremely weak once you step outside the hotel's entrance, had almost no signal at the smoking area, which is 2 steps outside.
6. Small as these things might be, on my next visit to London, I'd prefer staying at another hotel.",8.0,Good hotel with small annoying details

We upgraded to a balcony room which was facing the London eye, the views were so nice. The room was very clean, comfortable and big.", Nothing,10,Great Location

Beautiful hotel."," For a new 5 star hotel, we were disappointed to find the lounge door would not close; it’s completely misaligned with the door jamb.  The boys bedroom door would also not close - it hit the bed.  
Also - it was completely weird that they took our barely used bar soap every day and gave us new ones. Sustainability???  
In addition, we wanted to stay one more night and I thought it was ludicrous that the rate we were quoted was significantly higher than online pricing and instead of matching it - we were told to go away and book online. Seemed pretty crazy and inconvenient.

The room-safe did not work and needed fixed involving another two phone calls. The staff were overly keen to upsell additional products at check-in; breakfast, room upgrades, executive lounge facilities etc.... not what you need to face after a long and tiring journey to get there. The in-room coffee/tea/snacks were very basic and out of kilter with the room and the rest of the facilities - no coffee pods, biscuits and only 4 sachets of coffee/milk and 4 tea-bags......",8.0,"Great location, great room, comfortable bed, excellent views, slightly poor in-room refreshements."

I showed him and he proceeded to look through my email and gave my phone back and told me “I’m sorry we are fully booked”. I told him again I had a reservation and again asked him where the front desk was. He had a attitude and said “up there”. As I went up he followed me and lingered behind me the whole time until I finished checking in. He stood near the lobby/ elevator area until i got on. He made me feel extremely uncomfortable, unsafe and unwelcomed.
Thank God I had a great experience with the front desk Manager who was checking me in.
Later that day I went to the pool around 8:30pm. There was no one at the desk so I followed the signs and went into the ladies changing room to get ready to take a swim. The lady who worked there was in the dressing room and asked me to leave the room. I told her I was trying to go to the pool and she said I had to leave and told me to go to the Men’s changing room. I told her about 3 times I am a female but she insisted I belonged in the men’s room because I have short hair and continued to walk me out. I got a bit aggravated that’s when she backed off and “apologised” I was embarrassed she did that in front of people in the dressing room because I still had to go back in and change. When I was done she came in looking at me weird while I was changing. My shirt was off I felt a bit violated. When I was walking out she asked if I signed in. I told her There was no one here when i came in so i didn’t know I had to. So when I went to sign in she rudely said “well you don’t have to do it now”.",9.6,Mixed feelings

At check in I was not told that using my debit card against the deposit  would continue to hold funds against my current account for 5 days after. Despite asking at check out to cancel the charge against the debit card this was refused and there was no-one sufficiently senior to meet me or to confirm in writing that this charge would be removed. All it needed was to be given this information at check in and to be advised that I could also use a credit card. The check out staff were particularly unhelpful and would not allow me to speak to any acting manager.,8.0,excellent location and standard of room.

The dining area is very crowded and there is no direction as to the layout of the various dishes.  However the staff are quick to remove used plates and implements," Breakfast takes place in a very busy environment and the layout of the buffet style components are a bit confusing.  Coffee is served at your table from a thermos jug so may be lukewarm.  The main ingredients of the cooked breakfast are served from covered containers and if you arrive at a later time the contents are not piping hot,especially the bacon and sausages.  Diners flit from place to place in the buffet area so there is confusion as people get in each other's way.  Getting toast has to be judged so that by the time you get your cooked items there is still a chance the toast is warm.  In my view it would be better to have some element of waiter service for cooked items.",7.0,Hotel is in a great location for Central London.  Bedroom was very good.

Then offer of free bottle of house wine if we didn’t get the room cleaned during our stay. We chose this, how much mess can 2 adults make in 2 nights?? If we wanted new sheets & towels all we had to do was ask and they were provided. Equally any extra tea bags, tooth paste, toiletries etc, we just rang room service and they were brought up immediately. Very good service. 
The food at Joel’s restaurant was beautiful. The breakfasts were so filling too, with everything you could ask for and more!!
We used the pool which was a lovely temperature. How they think 25 people in it would be a good idea I can’t see. But when we used it there were between 2 & 6 people, so enough room to swim without bumping into others."," The main disappointment with our room was that it was an interior view. I’m not sure you could call it a view in fact. We were on the lowest floor and there was glass on the roof at the top (10 floors above us) but this didn’t let much light into our room. We ended up keeping the curtains closed for the whole stay as outside our window was an area people could walk to, we saw a seat near our window. I wasn’t keen that people could just walk around there and peer in. 
Consequently the room was very dark. The lighting was extremely dim. I found the whole hotel generally very dark. The lifts especially were almost black with a star effect on the ceiling. Quite atmospheric, but a little odd.",8.8,"Enjoyable stay, shame about lack of windows."

2982,United States of America,Superior Double Room,3 nights ,July 2019,Solo traveler," Firstly, I was very tired after a long journey from California that also includes delays and sleeplessness so when I arrived, I really just wanted to check-in and get some sleep. I arrived approximately two hours before standard arrival time to be able to get a room, maybe even a little bit sooner than that. The staff member who processed my check-in was very accommodating and fortunately, they had rooms clean and were able to allow me to check in. This speaks highly of the cleaning staff who were very efficient and for the guests who left on time for this to occur. 
They were very friendly, courteous and gave fantastic instructions on how to get to my room as I was so tired. 
The room was so much more beyond what I expected from the online photos. It was inviting, clean, modern and stylish in every way. I was so happy to have air conditioning in the immense heatwave that London was experiencing and a very comfy bed. 
I eventually ordered room service and not only were they very expeditious in bringing the food but it was hot and quite tasty. 
I thought the location was very central to everything and although I did not eat in the restaurants onsite, they were very nice looking and the food smelled wonderful.

3157,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room with Internal View,1 night ,July 2019,Group," Really comfy bedding and pillows, the aircon was remarkable. 
The spa has a good setup to relax and ease off."," The hotel reception area and terms of check-in are a bit confusing. I was told to pay a security deposit which I paid in cash but the room had the mini bar locked because I need to leave my card in holding.
The room service takes ages to come, a friend had to leave after more than an hour of waiting. 
No phone reception in the room for both of us and we had to rely on the WiFi which is not always desired, on request of room switching I had been held up for just about an hour and told sorry they haven’t got any other rooms available.
Spa being good enough doesn’t have space for a massage and it has to be booked on first come first served at a specific time. 
Breakfast items lack dairy and gluten menu, and the special items can be requested at a premium. 
Staff at kitchen and room service not English spoken hence need to rely on their managers, which is a bit of a let down if you’re paying a big sum for the stay. 
Parking garage nearby at a very affordable rate as compared to valet, valet park the car at the same place. A bit too extra charging just to bring the car from a stones throw.",7.1,Comfortable yet not great.
3158,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room - Disability Access,1 night ,June 2019,Couple," I walk with a cane and their accessible rooms are great. They seem to have different types of accessible rooms which is helpful. For example, I told them that I don’t use a wheelchair but I need a walk in shower as I can’t step over a bath. The room they gave us had a walk in shower but was (in my opinion) not ideal for a wheelchair due to lack of room on the side of the bed with the orange pull cord. But! It was perfect for me. I would always choose this hotel when staying in London. 
With regard to the staff - I had a nightmare of a journey to the hotel which caused me a lot of pain by the time I got there. The lady on reception asked me if I needed a wheelchair or any other assistance with bags to make it easier to get to my room. She was wonderful - I wish I’d taken a note of her name so I could write to thank her. 
Can’t recommend this hotel enough - it’s excellent!!"," Two small things - 
1) Because the doors on accessible rooms are set up to open automatically at the press of a button (which doesn’t seem to work though) there are no internal locks on the doors which makes me uncomfortable. 
2) I don’t know what they do with the breakfast mushrooms but they are ridiculously salty. They’re inedible because of it. The rest of the breakfast items are first class",9.6,Love this hotel!

The London Eye is practically next door. There’s a tiny market near Westminster bridge that was sure handy for snacks and fresh fruit."," The restaurant options in the hotel were very expensive with little for children, unless they’ll eat sushi. The restaurants immediately surrounding the hotel all seemed very cheap. There wasn’t much in the middle. Our American devices didn’t charge well here, even though the room had a large converter plug in. The hotel sent an electrician to check it, but he couldn’t find anything wrong.",9.6,Exceptional

Studio room upgrade was terrific with a great view on the Eye. Discount on the upgrade was considerable, also very nice. Bed was really fine. Express checkout was very convenient. Excellent dining facilities. Very fair minibar prices. Excellent room service."," On arrival they gave us a room for disabled people without bath and equipped with strings and ropes and red help buttons and lobby told us that when booking a superior double room one can end up with a room like this. Unacceptable, room was booked in january 2019, I'm not disabled, neither is my child, never informed about this ""possibility"". The upgrade studio room was perfect, but lead to additional upgrade costs, reasonable costs, but still unexpected extra costs. One pool sauna staff member was very unfriendly and gave us a sermon because my son of 11 used the sauna facilities after 20:00. This young staff member saw us before but instead of telling us to leave she decided to wait until we were finished and then talked to us like a Dutch uncle. I am very happy to oblige to the rules but inform us politely, do not patronize us. I am a very friendly and laid back person myself, not someone who does not care about rules. The other older staff member was very friendly and flexible, she said officially children cannot use the sauna facilities after 20:00 but as it was a very quiet evening she said something like let the boy have his fun, which was very nice of her. Now that is customer service!!!",8.8,Park Plaza Westminster july 2019

All the staff was friendly and kind. The live music at the Primo Bar was amazing and the non alcoholic cocktail I ordered was really nice. (It was the fruity one, not sure of the name.) Everything from the room to the changing rooms was so clean. The swimming pool was nice and warm but I would definitely recommend bringing googles because it was heavily full of chlorine which effected my own personal experience. I really loved the idea of towels where you could take one, use it, ""bin it"" and grab another one if you needed. This was really handy. The beds were so comfy and the light switch in the room was a clever touch.", A Jacuzzi would've completed the facilities. Some of the spa treatments could have been free but the more in depth treatments you would have to pay for. Buffet for dinner just like the breakfast would've been good. No shower gel or toothpaste in the room for some reason. There also should've been more access to free drinking water around the hotel.

Breakfast was the only bit that let the stay down from very cheap tasting sausages (I've had better at the Premier Inn!), to staff basically arguing with us in terms of what poached egg we had ordered. I admit it was our mistake originally but the rectification of the problem wasn't handled well by the member of staff we dealt with.

The staff was very helpful and kind but the main thing that stood out for me was the room, I loved my room, I had a view of London eye and inside the room we had a little lounge area where you could sit and enjoy a few drinks and listen to music on the tv. As you walked a little further in you had your bedroom where again you have another tv in there which offers chrome cast, it allowed me to play Netflix on the background and I loved it. 
You have a iron and iron board, you have a microwave and mini fridge, plates and glasses and even cutlery! I mean I have never been to a hotel which made me feel so much like home! 
I loved the bed it was a good size and really comfortable!

Room was lovely, really comfortable bed and the bathroom was great with a huge bath and separate shower. 
We had an internal room overlooking the atrium which was absolutely fine and really quite pretty.  It also meant there was very little noise from outside."," There were no English breakfast tea bags available in the room just various fruit and green tea,  and only four coffee sachets (two normal and two decaf)  which is really stingy for this type of Hotel.  Also being told that we had to book to go to the swimming pool in advance because of the number of guests in the hotel put us off using the spa.

It is too small and the equipment is tired and not all working and there is not enough.

3611,Slovenia,Superior Double Room with Internal View,4 nights ,May 2019,Couple, The cleaning ladies and doormen were very nice and helpful. The location was perfect for sightseeing.," We had confirmed when making a reservation that the hotel would offer vegan options at breakfast (and the price for it is expensive anyway). They said quote: ""I would also like to confirm that we offer fully vegan breakfast."" The breakfast receptionists were okay but they told me there were no vegan options available and that I should have made a request at the reception. So I went there and the reception informed me that I should have made a request at least 48 hours in advance. I told them that everything was confirmed through e-mail but apparently that wasn't enough. They told me I would only be able to get vegan breakast on the day of departure, so I said yes. And of course, again, there was no vegan breakfast provided. I ate strawberry preserves and baked beans for 5 days at breakfast, which is totally unacceptable, not least because of the price.
Also, the translation for the room type on booking was wrong. We had reserved a room with a view of surroundings and got one with an internal view. When we realised that the translation from English to Slovenian was wrong, we contacted Booking and they contacted the hotel but there was no answer of any kind. We could not explain any of this to the receptionist because he wasn't a good English speaker so we had to pay extra for an upgrade. I was very disappointed because this was not our mistake and also not our problem, but the hotel made zero effort to help us.

3745,Russia,Studio King (Family),3 nights ,April 2019,Family, The location of this hotel is perfect for london explorers. The breakfast is great and the service is good. Staff is helpful when problems arise.," There are a few things to mention. This is the second time we are in the hotel, last time we stayed in a room with windows to the inside of the hotel. This time the windows were with a view to the street. And closeness to the St. Thomas is a bit rough for light sleepers like myself. The only option here - to get so tired during the day, so you would not care about the street noise. If you are offered an upgrade with a city view - don't.
The final bill that you get charged when you've already left was is USD, even though I specifically asked for GBP, and the precharge was in GBP.  Double conversions cost money, in my case it was around 50 GBP.
Our bill had quite a few items from the minibar that we never touched during our stay. We cleared that at the reception, so one extra point to the reception staff and we extract one point from billing team or whoever was responsible for the mess up.
All the above seems like small things, but you would expect not to even think about those small things for a 400GBP/night rate.",7.1,My first review of the hotel was: definitely coming back here. The second: I am not so sure now.

We had a lovely day and couldn’t fault the hotel in any other way but when you arrive at 11 for a night cap to relax you want staff who at least take an interest and look like they want to serve you. As all of them were the same I presume there was an underlying issue with moral and motivation.,8.3,"Very nice hotel, great location but I wish the staff would smile."
3748,United Kingdom,Studio King (Family),4 nights ,April 2019,Family," The breakfasts were lovely. The rooms catered brilliantly for our family, spacious and clean. Beds were really comfortable.

Our first morning at breakfast we were shown to a huge conference room down stairs, presumably because the main restaurant can't cater for all the guests at the hotel, it did not make for a pleasurable dining experience or reflect the price we paid for our break.

We asked could we be refunded the price of our breakfast and we were told no but they could provide a breakfast box!!   Wasn't sure what that meant but where were we going to eat that....

It was obvious I was very upset. She made me feel stupid and told me he was not a child and could look after himself. She also stated "" he is probably out enjoying himself having a good time"" she said there was nothing she could do about it.  A touch of empathy and humanity would have been more appropriate.

Also paying £50 extra for the city view was useless because I was under the impression that it would be facing BigBen.

We checked in just before 2pm and our family room wasn't ready until 3.15pm but we appreciated it would have been a busy day, it didn't matter we got to enjoy a drink and a late lunch in the cosy hotel bar.

4419,Greece,Studio King (Family),7 nights ,December 2018,Family," The pros: hotel is located in a fantastic location, close to main attractions, underground stations (Waterloo & Westminster) and many bus services just outside the hotel. 
It’s a relatively big hotel at a central location, but its a quiet cove once you enter. The ambience and its scent is calming and inviting. We truly enjoyed the room we were assigned to. It is big, clean and modern. Our kids loved the pool though having to book in advance only for a 30 minute visit, is quite frustrating.
Will definitely return during our next stay in London hoping they will improve the staff shortcomings and the breakfast offering quality, especially the terrible Coffee."," We were quite apprehensive about choosing the hotel after reading mixed reviews online. However, my husband and I were pleased by Park Plaza westminster mainly because of the room, bathroom and the location, although some things should improve. 
The cons: Staff at check in was rather flat and impersonal, a very young lady with not much experience, didn’t make the best impression to us, and so did the woman in charge of the breakfast who didn’t even speak good English, what a shame... Breakfast was the worst aspect of this hotel experience as scrambled eggs taste was not good and coffee was terrible. Another negative aspect, sending people to the lower, underground floors to have breakfast, unacceptable for a hotel with 5star standards, fortunately we found a table at the Brasserie all 6 days in a row but the ambience and set up was really disturbing, waiting in long queues. As for the room, the design and layout is great at the King Studio, especially for a couple with two kids as the two sleeping areas are separated by the bathroom but there was a torn and worn leather chair at the desk and this seemed so unfit. Finally, housekeeping was spotless only on 2 of the 7 days of our stay, the remaining 5 the room was left almost unattended and this was probably because of the full occupancy during Christmas holiday season.",7.1,A great value for money stay in the best London area
4420,United Kingdom,Superior Twin Room with Internal View,4 nights ,December 2018,Family," Comfy bed, spacious room. Excellent shower and bathroom. Location. Room TV and You Tube access.

4429,United States of America,Superior Twin Room with Internal View,3 nights ,December 2018,Group," The hotel was perfect for what I was looking for:
Room: Internal View Twin - very comfortable, more than enough space for two people traveling. Only down side is it being internal unable to tell the time of day. This was both good and bad for Jetlag. Next time I would opt for a room with an outside view.
Bathroom: HUGE! Both walk in shower as well as tub with shower handle to wash off after soaking. Toilets are nice and overall very happy with the bathrooms.
Restaurants: Daily enjoyed the breakfast buffet, AMAZING. As an american that has never had ""English breakfast"" it was nice to have the buffet to ""try"" some of the signature dishes, but on days I wanted plain american breakfast I had that option too. 
I also had the chance to try the coffee shop (6/10) always very busy and staff seemed to move at a slower pace. Even getting water took about 15 minutes. But it was a nice reminder that I was on vacation and to relax.
I also enjoyed the onsite French restaurant - AMAZING (10/10) Both service, price, and food were perfect. I enjoyed the prix fix menu and would highly recommend to anyone to try at least one night. 
Check in: Fast, easy and friendly. Elevators are secure. Doors have staff to ensure all guests belong so it felt very safe", None!! Highly recommend!!,10,The perfect hotel for your London stay.

Near by the hotel was really hard to find any restaurants. 
We thought we would be eating the breakfast at an amazing view with the big ben as at the hotel pictures was, but in reality we were eating at two floor lower which was some hall.

Feel sadly let down by this hotel although they eventually sorted rooms but on different floors so family split up , I asked for upgrade of breakfast out of good will and they would not even do that !!! Not good customer service by any means , so now I will not be returning to this hotel of which is a very disappointing experience yet again .

The hotel was super busy so hopefully you would have a better breakfast experience, I feel bad being negative about such a lovely place but they should be able to cater for breakfast for their guests.",8.3,Very Good

The set of light switches by the bed gives the options of reading, mood, and off, of course. Dressing gowns were provided.", Breakfast was definitely not value for money. The toaster was too small - gave up on whole-wheat toast and grabbed a white stone-baked roll (the only non-sugary kind available) instead.

The hotel and its surroundings where quiet and calm, the hotel clean and tidy and the staff always eager to help.
It’s location in Westminster was quite close to both the Waterloo station/subway and Big Ben, so we didn’t have to walk far to get around. In addition it sits just next to the millennium/London Eye and all its museums, restaurants and spectacles, so there was plenty to both see and do just next to the hotel.
The breakfast was good, and you could find most things you expect from a traditional hotel"," The breakfast area was a bit crowded in the morning, and we often had to wait in line to get seated.

Not only did the lovely woman at the desk walk over to greet me, instead of the usual beckoning, because of the fraud alert on my card my payment was initially declined. She didn't scoff, there was no change in her manner or impeccable service and she kindly waited for me to alert my banks. This was impactful! It set the tone for my entire stay! I have been treated unkindly before in instances like this.  May I also add that I had been in three different time zones that week and I found late night room service was a god send!

One who had just booked at the counter next to me and one who'd booked prior to arrival, like I had.

Isolation is great, room was very quiet."," Price per night is quite high IMO and breakfast can be improved. the hotel served the same food every day with only one chef daily ""special"" course (its embarrassing to put the words ""chef"" and ""special"" next to the course). in general, the food was ok but no more than that.
Also, compared to other hotels i've stayed in, it would have been nice to get 1-2 bottles of still water for free on daily basis (again, based on the high price per night).

Food was great quality, staff friendly, and location is perfect.

Location was a six minute walk to Waterloo station which I used a lot. However, next time I will be choosing a hotel much more closer to a tube station because if its the main transport, you end up getting exhausted after a few days of walking around london. 
The hotel itself is very close to all the main attractions: Connects to westminister bridge so you can literally walk out of your hotel and onto the bridge, walking distance from Southbank which has a lot to do and London eye - and although longer, and if the weather permits and you're not too exhausted you can also walk to further attractions. 
Very clean, they also use elemis products for the bath and shower gel, staff was very responsive and would pick up the phone immediately."," This is just me, but although the hotel is four stars, huge and very stylish, i felt the rooms lacked a level of comfort.

The staff were very professional and quick to help or answer any queries we had. The breakfast, while expensive, was very tasty, convenient, and plentiful. The swimming pool is very enjoyable for a quick dip, and as children are not allowed before 8am or after 8pm, you can chose a quieter time for a swim if you prefer."," Housekeeping staff forgot to replenish certain supplies in the room on multiple days, which is a little disappointing. It's nothing that a quick phone call didn't fix, but I do feel like that is something that shouldn't happen in a hotel of this standing, and certainly not multiple times in a row. The headboard of the bed was very scratched and worn, with chunks of the faux-leather covering taken out of it, which did not make the room look very good. It was purely cosmetic, but again something that shouldn't be too hard for the hotel to fix. Lastly, one of the plugs in the room did not work.",8.8,"Great location, great service. One or two issues that made the stay less than perfect."

5103,United States of America,Superior Double Room - Disability Access,2 nights ,July 2018,Couple," The best thing about this hotel is the location.  It is slap dab in the middle of a lot of the tourist-y attractions.  You walk 5 mins across the bridge to Big Ben/Parliament and Westminster Abbey is about another 5-10 min walk from there.  The London Eye is about 2-3 blocks away.  We did walk from the Westminster Abbey area to Buckingham Palace, although not terribly far away, I think a quick taxi ride would have been better for us.  Also, we ate at the Brasserie Joel restaurant onsite, which was really good."," Most of the staff spoke English as a second language, so it was difficult communicating with these people in this English-speaking country!!!!  Also, they gave us a handi-capped room.  Therefore, the shower situation was a bit messy.  And, they provided instant coffee in the room, which was pretty gross.  Fortunately, there was a Starbuck's about a block away.",7.1,"Overall, a very nice hotel.  Would stay there again."

5164,United Kingdom,Studio Double Room with London Eye View,1 night ,December 2020,Couple, The Bed was comfortable," To put it frankly, we were all appalled at the poor standard of not only cleanliness but customer service which was offered, especially as the Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London is meant to be a 4 star hotel. 
I have attached the pictures of the abhorrent amount of limescale which was found in the shower, there was also dirt on the sink area, no towels or slippers and only one robe. The last straw in terms of the difficulties we faced in the bathroom area was when the bath fell apart, again I have attached a picture. 
Moving into the main part of the room, there were tea marks on the side of the sink, the cleaner came in and said that the state of the room was so bad that they need to move us to the floor above, which was the VIP floor, however the man who dealt with it stated that he was not willing to offer this. The fridge was also dirty and there was not even a bottle of water in it or anywhere around the room.  
The cleaner then used the same gloves she was using to clean to handle the teacups which was brought to our room.  
The quality of the complimentary breakfast was also very poor, considering the risk of COVID-19 we were shocked to see that our hot chocolates were brought to us uncovered and they also had a lot of sugar in them.

We probably spent more money on room service then they get in wages for the time we stayed. We would never stay at this hotel again.

Since I was in the toilet, I asked him if he can give me 10 minutes in order to be done and to open the door for him. However, he insisted on immediate entry to check if I was smoking cigarettes. Upon entry, the security noticed that there was no cigarette smell in my room and that it might’ve been a false complaint.
This intrusion of privacy and violation of personal space made me feel really uncomfortable at the hotel especially since the security was aggressive in his entry and all the staff at the hotel defended it as ‘hotel policy’. I believe that this hotel’s policy is harmful to their customers and extremely impolite. The way you are treated there is devoid of any human respect and they disregard the emotional damage caused by their violent actions. 
I advise no one to go through what I went through by boycotting this hotel and standing up to basic human rights. There are many other places to stay and I was deeply disturbed by this hotel’s denial of their wrong doings which constituted in a security man forcefully entering my room without good reason while I was completely naked to find out that there was no viable reason that could explain his entry.",1.0,Bad

5255,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,2 nights ,October 2020,Couple, The location of the hotel was good for our needs," It seemed to be a comedy of errors. It also feels Covid is being used as an excuse for poor service and facilities.
Plastic glasses and paper cups in the room for coffee and tea was very substandard. 
The fact that the rooms weren’t cleaned and checked the following day was dreadful. We had to call for toiletries (only enough for 1 shower!) and tea and coffee.
The desk area and parts of the lounge area were dirty.
The breakfast area again was like a poorly run cafe with pathetic excuses of scraps of tick box paper to order breakfast! The breakfast was dreadful with poor quality eggs and sausages, lack of taste and overcooked bacon. We had to have sachets of sauces and salt just to add insult to injury.
We cancelled our second day breakfast on our first day at the desk. Later that evening we checked on the TV as to the balance of our account. The charge for the following day breakfast was still included. My husband called reception and apparently it was rectified. 
We walked a short distance to ‘Giraffe’ on the Queens Walk and had an amazing breakfast with excellent service.
We tried to do an express (joke) checkout in the room but after 20 minutes of issues I contacted main reception. On the TV the account amount was correct. The woman on the reception did the checkout for me over the phone.
When we were in the taxi leaving I checked my email and had 2 invoices for the correct amount and an extra one for charges for the breakfast we hadn’t had! I called them and was passed from pillar to post with no apologies and almost accusing us for not cancelling the breakfast in the first place! After being put on hold while they were trying to speak to various members of staff for 20 minutes I asked them to call me back. I had a all back saying there’d been a technical error but no apologies.

Kept waking us up but they’d stop and go back in their rooms before we could call reception. I’m surprised the hotel staff didn’t monitor this via CCTV and do anything about it.

I was ""upgraded"" to an atrium room, but this meant I had to keep the curtains constantly closed to ensure privacy. I could easily see into the rooms opposite mine and i didn't want to feel like I was in a goldfish bowl

They moved us for a nice duplex with balcony that was beautiful and with beautiful views, although me and my husband slept on the sofa bed and it was the most uncomfortable night ever! The mattress is extremely thin with springs, it was horrible all our body hurt in the morning, thank goodness my kids where in bed, when we went to have a bath I noticed a few electrical cables on the floor underneath the sink, wich I think is very dangerous even more by a bath!!! Breakfast was the worst breakfast that I ever had in a hotel, very dry bacon, scrambled eggs tasted like someone already chew them before serving, overall very very disappointed even they tried to make it right, you should at least be more careful with the cleaning and change your chef as I can see we are not the only ones complaining about the breakfast, thank you very much but I am sure I won't return",4.0,Disappointed!

Staff did move us and family members to other rooms but these were unclean and and un-stocked rooms. 
Was told we’d receive a courtesy call from management which never happened so left us having to wait for them to be told guests would be evicted as they were aggressive.

The restaurant for breakfast was nice, food ok. Not sure why they didn't ask for ppl to advise of a breakfast time as there was alot of queuing and the food was lukewarm, this would have cut down on ppl waiting around. I asked for vegetarian sausages and got it so was happy, mushrooms abit weird as they were bitter and sweet at the same time so I didnt eat them.
The only gripe I have is that I asked for water for the kettle so I could have a cup of tea late at night and was told to use the tap water in the bathroom. I dont drink water from my bathroom and would not dream of filling up my kettle at home to give a friend or family member a cup of tea. I asked for plain tap water for the kettle from the kitchen and was told it would cost £5 for someone to bring it to my room, outrageous!!!!!!, I then told the receptionist I would come downstairs with my kettle if they could fill it for me I would be happy. I was told again this was not possible, im not sure why this was an issue as I stayed at Park plaza Victoria last month and they had no problem filling the kettle for me.

We were also not ever made aware that the valet parking was not actually available (as it was being used for NHS staff - brilliant gesture by the way), and that the car would be left overnight on the road outside the hotel, but charged the same amount. 
We booked the hotel for our 5 year anniversary and when I messaged the hotel to ask for something to be done, they replied saying how fantastic it was that I had booked for my daughter which I do not have(?!!). This lack of care and attention to detail set the tone for the stay: nothing was done in the room - having been given a courtesy bottle of bubbly or a cake to say happy anniversary.

Food at the hotel (in-dining) although expensive was very good quality."," Room Cleaning services were dreadful!! I phoned several times to get my room cleaned (especially because of COVID-19, you would think it was a priority!) but even leaving the hotel for 3-4 hours it still was not cleaned! One night I asked for room cleaning and they came and barely cleaned the room! I was and still am appalled! With two children especially, and the rating of the hotel and because I stayed 3 nights I was not happy.

5450,United Kingdom,One-Bedroom Suite with Big Ben View,2 nights ,August 2020,Group," We frequent this hotel as it is usual an all rounder and in a great location to everything we could possibly want for a weekend away in London, however on this occasion, we were left very disappointed."," We arrived on this bank holiday to find that there were cones up at the entrance of the hotel, which is highly unusual as there is usually a member of concierge there to greet you, unload your luggage and take your car from you. At this point, we called the hotel who informed us that the car park was fully booked and we would need to find another car Park off site and carry our suitcases back to the hotel. Very frustrating that we were not told in advanced that the hotel would at full occupancy or that the hotel couldn’t think of a solution and instead passed the problem onto the customer. I would have at least expected an offer of a concierge to come and meet us to take out luggage whilst we went to find an alternative car park near by.
Upon arriving to the hotel with our luggage, we checked into a very worn and underwhelming room. Not what we would usually expect after paying a substantial price for a suite. There were no glasses in the room, so we were unable to have a drink right away. The hotel was particularly busy this weekend, which significantly slowed down any guests services.

5455,Norway,Studio King (Family),6 nights ,August 2020,Family," The location was excellent. The breakfast delivered to the room was a nice touch, but during a week long stay, twice the order was not picked up at 2 am as was repeatedly promised and twice the orders were not correct. The beds were very comfortable and there were two TVs in our room which was good for our daughter to watch separately."," The advertisement on booking.com stated the room had both a kitchenette and a mini-bar. To us, a kitchenette means that there is at least a mini-refrigerator -- which we needed and specifically chose the room for in order to store medication that needed to be refrigerated. When we got to the room, there was something that appeared to be refrigerator, but it seemed to be broken because it was basically room temperature. After calling down and reporting it as broken, we were told that this is not a 'refrigerator' -- but, instead, a 'cooler' (Zoltan and Samantha - staff who we engaged with) that only cooled at about room temperature (what good is that?).  Perhaps they thought we were being difficult, but we explained that we specifically chose the hotel because of the kitchenette and we didn't even think that we needed to ask if there was at least a refrigerator that cooled properly. Since we definitely needed a refrigerator and didn't want to store important medication with the staff at the front office (the medication needed to be used several times per day), we were told that the only thing they could do was to offer a higher price studio for 60 pounds extra per night. Unhappily, we took the offer only because we were desperate for a refrigerator and had several medical appointments that we didn't want to be jeopardized by trying to find a new hotel room and perhaps not getting refunded. To me, the booking advertisement should be changed to at least define what they mean when they say kitchenette (for example, state that there is only a 'room temperature cooler' and not a 'refrigerator', very limited kitchenware (two sets of cutlery), no plates and no glasses or cups (only plastic ones in the bathroom), and no stovetop or pots and pans.

- Breakfast order was incorrect.
- No brown sauce delivered with breakfast. After requesting this, two pots of sauce which were 6 months out of date turned up to the room 15 mins later once I’d already finished my meal.

After taking over an hour to get checked in and dealing with your rude security staff upon entering the building. It didn’t take me long to realise there are no facilities open at the moment inside your hotel.. so after waiting patiently for around half an hour to get a lift to pick us up and take us to the fifth floor... we found our room exhausted by all the check in nonsense and Practically having to fight for a lift.. it was left with bins still not emptied from prior guests and dirty toilet roll behind the toilet.. I passed a cleaner in the hallway so went back out to inform him he looked at me smiled and didn’t even take the bin off me so I just sat it in the hallway along with the half empty trays of food dotted outside rooms they stayed there until I checked out the next day...I would not expect this at a 3 star B&B outside of COVID-19 times let alone when we’re in the middle of a global pandemic! Utterly embarrassing! So let’s fast forward to around midnight.. upon ordering a film to watch with my partner we decided we wanted to use room service for some ice cream... nice thought that was because after not answering for 20 minutes and 3 phone calls.. I finally got through to someone only to be told that there was an hour and half wait for room service... for ice cream!! Pathetic to say the least! How this hotel is 4 stars is completely beyond me! I’ve had camping trips with more amenities and facilities! Stay clear and avoid at all costs waste of time and money! This was meant to be a romantic stay for our anniversary it turned out to be a nightmare to forget! (See pictures of dirty filled bin left in room) Hilton hotel and county hall offer nicer places WITH facilities to use and similar price!

After travelling 8 hours by car with 3 children so we were really tired and our check in took 30 min bcs the lady in reception, first can`t find our reservation, need to register all person with all details, then we had a problem with payment - we would like to pay in local currency but we had a problem with card. There was no any understanding that we could receive for ex. min one room that our children can go and we can came in next 1 hour to finish registration or we can make authorization for payment - but not final payment. NO - we need to pay all and unfortunately not in local currency. There was no proposal  for solution in this situation, the lady in reception was unbelievable rude and we need to stay all  5 person next 30 min not like a guest but like a poor people without money on account. Never again. So the first view was not good but was only worst next day.

The  day started stressful with customer service at reception being poor upon collecting our room key we asked if there was luggage and cot and sofa bed ready for our kids as they needed a nap and I was informed yes. Upon on arrival to room 747 no sofa bed was ready and there was no cot and no luggage. Called guest services to let them know immediately and they said they will send someone now ASAP guess what 25 minutes later and no one came and no call to apologise for delay. We call again and get told someone will arrive soon. Again noting we call call again and third time we get someone to room finally after one hour to do sofa bed & cot bed arrives. But guess what no luggage still we then call again get informed that one of us has to go down ourself to collect bags and confirm room numbers !!! Seriously it made no sense. Very disappointing to be honest. 
Also please note  breakfast buffet style but  is very basic eggs Are not well cooked more like soggy scrambled eggs taste watery!! Not much options either you have toast , beans , bacon etc and cold option is very limited items. 
On check out I gave my key back and wasn’t even asked how was your stay just shows how much they care about customer services. I tried to share what happend to me but no one was listening either so I gave up.

5766,Ireland,Superior Double Room,1 night ,October 2019,Couple, Food at the Joel Braserie," This weekend, we checked into the hotel as business guests to get some rest after a manic week and specifically make use of the spa facilities. It was our first time in the hotel. Unfortunately, our experience was far from relaxing from the moment we stepped through the door. Despite paying extra on booking.com for an upgraded room, we were given a room that looked out on to concrete walls and told an upgrade to see the river would be £90. We were then told we need to 'book a slot' to use the swimming pool as the hotel was busy. Slightly puzzled, we booked a slot at 5pm and went to get something to eat whilst we waited for our allocated slot. Once we did go down to the spa area, we were unable to use the pool as it was packed to kids. Of course, children are welcome to use the facilities, but it would definitely be helpful if there were more slots for adult only use. (Currently only 8-10pm at night). We tried to lie back and read, but it was impossible with all the screaming, and we were also not allowed to use phones because of the children in the pool. This hotel is in line price wise with other 4 and 5star hotels in the area but it is way below par. We travel lots globally with work and this was the least pleasant stay we have had in a long time. On the sat night, after our experience in the spa, we reported our experience to a very friendly and understanding lady on guest relations. She was helpful and listened and said she would speak to a manager to see what could be done. However, when we returned the next morning, a different clerk said there was nothing that could be done.

Window in the room do not open which was not mentioned at the time of booking.

When I asked the waitress about the complementary porridge (mentioned by the Usher when she led us to the last table), the waitress said she was not sure about it and she needed to checked with her colleague. but she did not show up after that and nobody came to us again. So I went to the front door to look for the Usher and told her that the waitress said she was not aware about the complementary porridge. The Usher replied that ""she knows"".  So I am not sure why the waitress said ""she is not aware"" and the Usher said ""she knows"". If the waitress knew, why didnt she serve us? Is she on-the-job trainee?

There were no plugs alongside the bed which was a pain for charging my phone. I had to queue for breakfast as it was crazy busy. The glass I used was chipped which I felt was dangerous. It was hard to find plates at bowls at the buffet. The towels in the bed room had black stains on them. The room was really very dark. The reading light above the bed was set in the ceiling which was really uncomfortable as soft lighting if you just want to pop to the loo in the night or wind down in the evening. The condiments in the bathroom were limited. The breakfast made it feel like a budget hotel.. for the price of £220 I thought that wasn’t good enough! The giant shrek made the place look really tacky and cheap! I was annoyed to be given a twin room as I was travelling without my partner and had deliberately booked a superior double room.. so had to go back to the desk and change rooms which took some time.

5838,United Kingdom,Studio King (Family),2 nights ,August 2019,Family,," I had previously stayed at this hotel and enjoyed my stay. However, the service on this occasion was very poor and not what I would expect of a 4* hotel. When I arrived at the check in desk there was one person in front of me. Others arrived and formed another queue. A member of staff arrived with a clip board and came over to me and the girl in front of me and insisted that we join the back of the other queue. I am disabled and use a walking aid. It would be obvious that standing for any length of time would cause me difficulty. It took over 20 minutes standing before I was served. Initially I was told the booking was for a double room. I had to prove showing my booking confirmation that I had booked a studio king. I asked for a room on the 2nd floor as I have difficulty with stairs and would struggle to evacuate the hotel in an emergency. 
After having to queue again at reception at 2pm for another 10 minutes, I was told the room was not ready and eventually, after complaining, I was given a room on the 6th floor which was dangerous for someone with mobility issues . I was told that a room on the 2nd floor would not be ready until between 4 - 5pm as they were ""very busy"". 
The room lacked basics such as towels and tissues. I tried to ring reception to ask for items but there was no answer. This did not improve on the second day after room service had cleaned the room. The last time I stayed in this hotel, the room was supplied with dressing gowns and slippers, but not on this occasion.
We ordered lunch in the bar and my meal arrived cold. I had to carry my plate over to a member of staff as I was being ignored to ask for the food to be replaced. When it was eventually returned it was set in front of me without an apology. 
In summary, this was the poorest service I have received at any hotel. The two night stay cost me £670 and was definitely not worth it.",5.4,"Very disappointing, not worth the cost. Do not stay here if you are disabled!"

6. Desk has power strip with UK, US and euro outlets to connect my phone and laptop chargers. Maximum 2.4 amps, so it cannot be used for anything else."," 1. There is only 1 spare electrical socket, which we switched back and forth for ironing and hair drying. It is located in the worst place - a very dark entry hallway.
2. In order to hook up my medical device (CPAP breathing machine) at night, I had to crawl on the floor to disconnect the phone to use its outlet.
3. Hotel does not provide extension cords or electrical adapters.
4. Cannot unplug the floor lamp for other uses. The hotel engineer explained that was because the floor light was made in India with Indian plugs (Type D) and the outlets on both sides of the bed are Type D to match. UK plugs (Type G) will not fit in them.
2. There was only one short towel rack that doubles as a handicap grab bar and there is very little counter space in the bathroom. The maid leaves the fresh towels on the counter, reducing further the counter space.
3. Shower has no curb (possibly because this was a handicap room), so water splashes far into the bathroom, even if I'm very careful.
4. Most of the bedroom lighting comes from narrow beam spotlights in the ceiling aimed at the bed and desk. This leaves half of the room in darkness.
5. The bathroom door is glass so if I go to the bathroom at night, the light shines out into the room and wakes up my wife.
6. Very difficult reaching the toilet paper behind the toilet, so we removed it from the dispenser.
7. The light over the bathroom mirror are also spot lights angled vertically downward, which exaggerates facial wrinkles.
8. The magnifying make-up mirror attached to the wall is about 9 inches too low for an average woman. If my wife angles the mirror, she is looking downward and blocking the only light coming from the ceiling.",6.0,The room is VERY dysfunctional; the public areas are quite nice

Checking in took long time - there was a large queue and only 2 recepcienists. 
Service was very poor. I correspondenced with the hotel in advance letting them know we needed a side by side rooms. They said they would do their best to locate us in 2 consecutive rooms. The check-in recepcienist wasn't even aware of that. She asked me to show her the correspondence. I did. Her response was - well I don't have availability currently for consecutive rooms and in the email we only promised to do our best. 
We booked the second room with 2 separate beds. Of course we received a room with one double bed instead. 
Breakfast was disaster. Very noisy, food quality was mediocre, it was a huge hall in which hundrads of people were walking around - you couldn't get your breakfast coffee with a peace of mind. 
The elavators to the floors were always very busy. We could sometimes wait over 10 minutes to be able to join the ride. 
Location isn't the best. Although it is next to the London eye and the Big Ben. The best place to stay is the Covent Garden next to the theaters. 
The only good thing was that they let us shorten our stay with them and replace a hotel.",5.4,Fair

I upgraded my room but they wouldn’t put the twin beds together to make a double bed. They said they would but it didn’t happen. 
Quality of the food is poor. Ordered room service and breakfast in my room. Room service menu reasonable but the quality is not good for the price. Poached eggs at breakfast not soft!!!
The room is ok but minimal amenities available. I was on the 10th floor and still had a view of the internal facade of the building. Very little natural lighting. 
Most frustrating factor of all is there is very poor reception for mobile phones anywhere in the building. Had to join the throng of people going outside the hotel to use their phone. Unacceptable in this day and age.

The gentleman who came to put a cot in our room was also lovely.," Check-in: very inefficient with lots of details from our booking.com reservation not making it to the reception staff. Eight guests waiting at check-in and at least that many staff on front desk eg waiting time was at least thirty minutes. Staff and managers weren’t communicating. The woman who checked us in ultimately could not get on with her job as another staff member kept interrupting her. There was a man sat at the Raddison Rewards counter who could have helped his colleagues to reduce the queue but didn’t. Staff would frequently leave and disappear. The organisation and flow through front desk needs looking at. 
Sofa bed in room 354: should not count these as extra sleeping spaces. Our four year old couldn’t sleep on it as it was so uncomfortable. My wife had to sleep diagonally with feet coming off as there were too many bumps. Really disappointing.

The description header stated the room was for one person - but in the details it said up to 3 adults and 1 child... so I booked it for myself and my partner. It then wouldnt let me add another person - my wife, for breakfast. When I checked in the front desk said it's only booked for one..... then I had to explain why! When I got to the room - there was a double bed and a sofa bed that was set up. Why was this the case when it only allowed booking for one person??
My wife's vegetarian breakfast had pork sausages in the plate, mine had vegetarian despite ordering bacon and eggs. We ordered breakfast in bed at 09.15, the cleaner knocked once and walked in at 10.00 - whilst my wife was going into the shower. We could have been doing anything! 
In the evening a drunkard came and sat opposite us (wandered in from somewhere outside) and started falling asleep and drooling all over the floor. Then proceeded to take a can of beer out of his pocket and start drinking it. We asked security if they could help move him on - despite there being security on the entrance to the hotel 24/7. How did that happen.
If I wanted to book into the premier inn I would have done so - but I paid top dollar and no one has got back to me about my complaint. Obviously they have taken the money for the room and offered nothing in return.
The guest manager took a note of our complaints - (we only complained about 2 of the above issues) and said someone will get back to us. Yet - nothing. I'm not about to chase it up either.

2. The Location is absolutely perfect. Easy to reach everywhere. Including to Luton Airport :) by Underground and Bus after.
3. The pool is nice and the water is warm. My kid enjoyed it.
4. Room Service is nice though expensive. Same for Plaza on The River.ii"," Where to start with?
1. First of all the hotel is charging a deposit - 300 GBPs for me and my 5 years old kid for 5 nights.
I checked out on 5th. Today is Tuesday, 7th, and my 300 GBP is still blocked. They should release the deposit on check out date and not one week after. Their a Hotel, God Damn, and not a Bank.
I had the same situation last year with Plaza on The River.
2. I have booked a King Studio Family Room which is not the cheapest.
When first checked in I received the worst room on a corner of the building with no view whatsoever and smelling like cigarettes. And that is in a non-smoking hotel.
Went back to check in desk. The lady there was a little confused but nice and willing to help. I asked for a room with a little view as this is the reason why I didn't booked the cheapest room in the beginning. 
She only could upgrade my room view if I pay 100 extra GBP. Fine. I paid. I got the most amazing room view on top of Westminster Bridge. Room 767.
3. The Pool - different story - you need to book your time and you can only stay for 30 minutes. It's true that I did not got kicked out after 30 minutes.
4. Breakfast - Absolutely Terrible and the same each morning. A breakfast for a motel, and not for a 4 Stars Hotel.

It looks more like a factory or an etap hotel than a luxury one!
I think that booking should write that there is a tiny swimming pool for 1900 rooms then the client can decide if he takes that or go to the nearest appartement !
You are fooling the client and this is not fair!
If I pay for this service I dont need to check if its available everyday !
The same thing for going to have breakfast 
Forget it go take breakfast somewhere else !
There were only trainees in the front desk they gave us wrong info everytime we asked for something 
At the end in check in the receptionist didnt give me back the change when I paid!
When I went back and asked for it he told me that I was in hurry!

However, I am deeply disappointed after my stay. 
The quality does not correspond to the price.
1. We made a trip in vain with our heavy luggage because the guidance staff on the ground floor led us to the wrong direction.
2. The receptionist at the front desk is too impatient to explain to us what option we had on housekeeping.
3. The door hanger falls off every time when opening the door. As a star-rated hotel, do you not have any better options?
4. When is the last time you flip or replace the mattress? It sags.
5. I understand that the work of housekeeper is hard. However, how could you forget to replace/refill the amenities all the time? The housekeepers even hid the tissue box behind towels and did not provide tissue paper. Does this mean we shall not use tissue paper anymore? Cotton swab, shampoo and shower gel were provided occasionally based on their mood, until they decide not to provide them anymore. Towels and bath towels were not replaced by new ones (used ones were placed in the bath tub, since the floor was too dirty). The housekeepers did not care about customers’ needs at all. Also, the floor and desk was not cleaned or wiped during the weekend cleaning.
6. The dry cleaning service provided by Park Plaza is not professional. One of my shirt got stained, and the other one got a burned spot on it.
7. Do not ask the receptionist any question, because she would be impatient and roll her eyes at you.
8. The light fixture, sofa and hangers were worn or stained and shall be cleaned or replaced.
Despite all these, I still appreciate the staff helped loading our luggage in the taxi.",5.8,Okay

The food kept running out but all staff were trying their best.
I have never come across such rude and uninterested staff in the bar area in my life. All the girls who served us were unfriendly and simply unhelpful. No eye contact, no smile, we were even called liars when they got the orders wrong supplying 2 coffees not 1. Marina was the worst offender but they were all a disgrace. The carpet in this area is also a disgrace , filthy dirty. I can only assume this part of the hotel is run by different people to the hotel itself which was of a reasonable standard.
The receptionist did not email us when our room was ready as promised when we tried to book in early. She was too busy trying to upsell us to a better room - we hade already spent enough on 3 nights thanks!
When we joined the queue for the second time as the booking in time was well past that advertised the second receptionist was doing ok until she asked me if I would be able to find my way out in the event of a fire. when I replied yes she asked me to sigh a form and disappeared to get one. On her return I asked why I had been asked this as never before has this question arisen she said ' I noticed you have difficulty walking'  I was furious and insulted and in fact when recanting this to friends later I burst into tears. I do have a slight walking limp due to knee issues but was unaware that this made me an invalid. I swim every day, I play Badminton 2 hours a week, I play table tennis 6 hours a week and walk 8 miles every day. How rude was she? I am still furious and offended.
The practice of charging 12.5% service charge is ridiculous on everything you buy. Either be honest with your prices or wait to be offered a gratuity. It is embarrassing to have to ask for it to be taken off and I heard people moaning about it the whole weekend.

Breakfast was appaling, after first day experience we made a desicion to take it at a nearby Pret a Manger instead (even though  we had it prepaid with our booking) Staff in general were friendly and helpful, but hotel bar  manager Martin was quite rude. We had two 5 year old boys by our table, and naturally it was quite hard to keep them sat down. They were running around our tabble (not interfering with other peoples evening) which was fine, as there was quite a lot of space as the bar was not crowded at all. The manager came over and asked us to keep the kids sat down, which was unusual, especially for the hotel advertising itself as ‘family friendly’ as they were not interfering with anyone. When we pointed that out to him, he said something like ‘I dont care about you at all, it is dangerous for the kids to run around like that and gave some examples about hot soup which could somehow be spilled on them. All of this was happening ~5-6pm. Other small disadvantage- there is no ‘in-hotel’ car park, only a valet prking option, which means that your car is being taken to an off-site car park. It can take up to 30 mins to get the car if you need it. In general, my advice- if you are on a budget, it is an ok hotel, but I personally would rather stay further away from the city centre and pay the extra £10 for the cab than stay here again. I’ve previously stayed in the Double Tree and Thistle chains (same price level) which are much better/more convienient allround.

Approx £250 extra taken off of my card without my consent, including the 'free upgrade' charge. For a top rated hotel that's not the greatest way to deal with a customer who has been inconvenienced at check-in by a lack of looking for the booking correctly.

Notwithstanding to mention, the Japanese restaurant called Ichi, that I asked at 4 pm on25th December, about if it was necessary to reserve a table; the hostess informed me that it wasn't necessary,  because the service it will be provided by order of arrival.

Bearing in mind there was no way they were going to sell any more rooms for that night as it was gone midnight, there was no attempt to resolve the situation apart from insisting on the £25 payment.  I agreed in the end but then said I would be making a complaint.  It was only then that she asked me to hold as she must have gone to speak with someone.   She then came back and said she would upgrade.   For the sake of £25 the hotel left a bad customer experience.  Not what you would expect from a radisson group hotel.

6146,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,3 nights ,November 2018,Couple, The location was excellent.," I booked a superior double room at a cost of £750 for three nights without breakfast. When we got to our room it was an interior room facing other hotel bedrooms which meant we had to keep the curtains closed to have any sort of privacy, and therefore with very little light. I went to complain as when I booked it I asked for a room with a view of Westminster Bridge, the Customer Relations Manager I spoke to was arrogant, dismissive and at times patronising. I was informed that all the superior double rooms are inward facing and that if I wanted another room I would have to pay a discounted rate of another £50 per night, adding another £150 to the amount I had already paid. It was very clear that he had no intention of acknowledging that as a customer I had the right to complain. In addition there was dust on the pillows, scuff marks on a chair and a mark on the bedding. When my wife and I returned to our hotel in the evenings we were met by security staff who in my view were surly and indeed I felt that there was little warmth from the staff in general. I would most definitely not stay at this hotel again, I have stayed at many hotels in London, costing less money and had a wonderful experience.

6223,United Kingdom,Studio King (Family),1 night ,August 2018,Family," Location, room size and comfort.", The check-in trainee tried to up-sell a bigger room. As this was in front of my wife it created an awkward experience. It was poor judgement to ask the question and not what I expected having booked a £200 per night room. The pool was far too small for the size of hotel and the overflow breakfast area resembled an out of the way store room.,6.7,The stay was good. Location and room quality were the best features.

Cupboards were dusty and we found a cockroach crawling in the cupboard. Bathroom supplies were inconsistent. It seems like the hotel was understaffed with regards to general housekeeping services.

6471,United Kingdom,,1 night ,August 2020,Couple, Really liked the location of the hotel and having a view of the London eye. Really liked how comfortable the best was and how relaxing the bathtub was.," There seemed to be some miscommunication about stair use. There was a sign at the entrance to the lobby elevators with COVID safety information on, which said that the stairs should be used when going down floors (and we could see why, since only a single group was allowed in each lift and having it stop on several floors on the way back to the lobby just creates annoyances for everyone involved - those waiting for knowing they couldn't come in to half of the lifts that showed up, and us for having to close the doors on strangers). However, when we attempted to use the stairs in the morning we were told by a member of staff that we were not allowed to because they were for staff access only! Perhaps the sign in the lobby was directed at staff members? If so then it should have said so. Or perhaps there were multiple staircases? In which case we could have done with directions to the proper staircase on each floor. Or perhaps we were doing the right thing after all? In which case not all staff members had been made fully aware of the changes. For what it's worth though, having guests travel back down to the lobby via the stairs when possible does seem like a good idea!
Additionally, there was mould on the ceiling above our shower, which really hampered the hotel's air of extravagance.",7.0,Good

I didn't know that it's even an option in this kind of high-level hotel. They told me at the reception that this is an interior room. I thought it's a room with inside view (not street view), but it has no view at all. If I knew at the beginning i wouldn't have booked. The cleaning was awful.

6582,United Kingdom,,1 night ,November 2019,Family," The building is easy to get to by car and transport and is situated directly opposite St Thomas Hospital (which is where I needed to be the next morning). 
Inside the building is grand, well decorated and designed with helpful staff from the moment you arrive. I arrived with my mother and we had full access to the swimming pool, sauna and steam facilities. 
My mother and I took advantage of a Wowcher deal which we pre-booked which included 4 spa treatments. The Mandara Spa is jaw-droppingly gorgeous, although my technician gave an average treatment and there was a loud banging noise coming from the shower which is located inside the room (this sounded like someone was working on it and did not make for a relaxing treatment experience. 
The main reception staff at the spa were thoughtful (giving me a good luck card for my hospital treatment taking place the next day). Little touches go a long way! The communication between Mandara Spa and the main reception for the spa (and vice versa) made for a seamless transition from different experienced that was offered on the wowcher deal.
The swimming pool was luke warm and looked heavenly. So much so, I was sure to get up for 6am opening and go for a morning swim then relax off in the sauna steam again. If I didn’ have to rush off I would’ve enjoyed myself in the deep bath in my bedroom - be sure to pack bath-salts and bubbles! 
We had access to the executive lounge for evening treats. The walk through to the seating area is beautifully decorated and the lounge area was super relaxing with a good range of vegetarian option (we did let them know we preferred the halal menu) and a view of London in its glory.
Room service and housekeeping also were faultless. 
I will be looking to book a stay again in the next couple of months and hopefully will take advantage of the restaurants too. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and made the most of it, even if it was for just the night!", Would have preferred a spa technician who tailored the treatment to what I required (massage pressure) instead of telling me that she’ll only do it her way. Her technique felt a little bit like slapping butter on toast.,9.6,Can’t wait to re-book!

I don’t come on holiday in a 4 star hotel to undergo police interrogation like what is the name of the 2nd guest, when is she/he coming,... Yes I might expect someone and maybe this person doesn’t want her/his identity revealed. It’s called privacy and it’s respected in all the hotels with decent standing.
- When you advertise a swimming pool in your hotel, you should also mention that its use has to be booked at the reception due to its small size and reduced capacity

The fried breakfast didn't feel 'fresh' at all - all tinned mushrooms, the pre-made scrambled eggs.  You have to pay extra for anything freshly prepared.  I have honestly had significantly better breakfasts at the Premier Inn Hubb across the bridge from you.  It seems a shame really, as I paid more to stay somewhere really nice with my daughter as a special treat for her.",7.9,Good

The shower had an issue as the water flooded the floor.  I have to say that they promptly sent a maintenance guy to fix it, though, despite it being 8pm.  The issue that they need to solve is the noise made by housecleaning staff early in the morning (before the check-out time).  They go to each and every door and bump their cards against the hard-wood doors, making a loud and unpleasant noise.

6967,Denmark,,2 nights ,September 2019,Family, Perfect location next to London eye," The air in the room was so dry and dusty, i’ve got an astma like symptoms for the first time in my life. My 11 years daughter had also breating problems. That ruined our stay.I had to cancel my London tour and book another flght. Came home 1 day earlier than planned.  i explained the problem at the reception But  they didn’t care much. And of course still charged me for the whole stay. Bad style 
On top of all, the windows were so muddy that the room seemed even darker than it was. The brekfast was way below average and the coffee was owful. The only plus- i ordered 2 pizzas from the room dervice which happened to be amazing",1.0,Avoid
6968,Canada,,2 nights ,September 2019,Group, The check-in process was quick and the person helping us was very nice., The room had no windows and the price was too high to not have any windows/fresh air.,6.0,Pleasant
6969,Ireland,,1 night ,September 2019,Couple, The lobby area is warm and inviting and breakfast was lovely. I can see it’s appeal for business people.," Check in was very slow and the staff rather dismissive. The natural lighting in the room was poor and there was no mirror at a seated area or with a plug if you wished to do your make-up or hair. Also, there was no complimentary water in the room which is standard in many hotels now.",5.8,Okay
6970,United Arab Emirates,,3 nights ,August 2019,Couple, Good breakfast, Was given a handicapped persons room. Was very awkward for an able bodied person,5.0,Fair
6971,United Kingdom,,1 night ,August 2019,Couple, Good location.," I was made to wait a long time for a room despite it being in the evening apparently there was an issue with room availability. The member of staff wasn’t very friendly. Queues for check in were long.  I was then sent to a room designed for wheelchair users but not forewarned that this was to be the case. Red emergency cords were plentiful - even dangling over the bed.  A fully equipped disabled bathroom compromised the quality of the fit out and normal standard of this hotel. This wasn’t a nice experience for my partner and I, it was meant to be a romantic treat further added to as the room also had an interconnecting door kept being shaked by the next door room occupants. The ice bucket was also full of stale water - made me feel as though the room hadn’t been properly cleaned since the last guest. Really unpleasant. I was pleased to leave. I completely support the need for accessible rooms but I would not have booked this hotel if I had been told this was the only option - I had booked a superior room but instead felt as though I was in a hospital.",4.2,Disappointing
6972,United Kingdom,,3 nights ,August 2019,Solo traveler,, Extortionate room rate increase for extending one day.,5.8,Disappointing
6973,Italy,,3 nights ,August 2019,Couple, Good location, The room was with a very little window and a bad cleaning of the table during the breakfast,5.4,Fair
6974,Italy,,2 nights ,August 2019,Couple, Close to Waterloo and easy walk to centre of London., Small room with no window - considering the price paid this was very poor value for money.,6.2,Pleasant
6975,United Kingdom,,1 night ,August 2019,Couple,," We stayed for one night in a superior room, which was all good but for a heavily scarred head board...and staff coming into room whilst we were getting ready and only making their presence known upon realising the room to be occupied. Then knocking on at 08.15 on the day of check out to clean the room.",6.7,Pleasant
6976,Czech Republic,,5 nights ,July 2019,Couple," Location is Věry good, near to everywhere.", Too much anonymous guests. Room was dark. Window   to nowhere.,5.8,Okay
6977,South Africa,,6 nights ,July 2019,Family, That the location was very close to everything.," The room wasn't ready when we got there @ 19:00, when we moved some furniture there was chips under. The hotel was in full capacity so it was a nightmare to get a table for breakfast. The hotel isn't for kids.",6.2,Pleasant
6978,Romania,,4 nights ,June 2019,Group, The surroundings," Breakfast. From cans.
Hotel,black everywhere  ,no open fresh air",3.3,Poor
6979,United States of America,,4 nights ,June 2019,Family, The room was clean and the twin beds were comfortable.," Television didn't work. It would randomly turn off every few minutes. Sometimes the screen would just be blank, other time the picture would freeze, but randomly the TV would turn off completely. 
Also room faced interior of building, so there was no outside view from the room. This was not mentioned when I made my reservations.",6.2,Pleasant
6980,United Kingdom,,1 night ,June 2019,Couple, The staff was nice and hotel was nice, Im not the type to complain usually. But i emailed the hotel 3 times explaining its my wedding one night before. We travelled 230 miles from yorkshire and chose your hotel as it is nice and clean. I requested roses to be put on the bed i even said i’ll pay extra etc i paid for a room upgrade you guys emailed back saying roses will be put on the bed i promised my wife roses and you guys didnt put any on? Kind of ruined the full night our first special night..,6.2,Pleasant
6981,United Kingdom,,1 night ,May 2019,Couple,," The customer service was disgusting will never use this hotel and make sure my friends and family don't as well.
There was no care when dealing with a delicate situation.",2.5,Very Poor
6982,United Kingdom,,1 night ,May 2019,Couple, Comfy bed, Had a disability accessible room no window so no view,6.7,Ideal location would have preferred a window for the price we paid
6983,United States of America,,3 nights ,April 2019,Solo traveler, Location was close to my meetings, Cost and impersonal nature of the hotel,2.9,Great location for Westminster
6984,United Kingdom,,4 nights ,April 2019,Family," Breakfast was a disaster, we were placed downstairs with makeshift facilities,   cooked 
breakfast cold, coffee served in flasks,   not what is expected.    we had to go out for breakfast from there on,   this was a great inconvenience to us-   there were 7 in our party
2 rooms"," the carpets in bedroom and corridors were sticky and dirty.   no excuse now a days.
Breakfast was a disaster.   would not recommend breakfast .   our Son and his family have booked a week your hotel in Summer.   Hope things are improved before  that.",6.7,well placed.   we ate in your Bar and food and service  very good
6985,United Kingdom,,1 night ,March 2019,Couple,, Sink in bathroom did not retain water with plug in.  No outlook from window in our room apart from windows of rooms opposite and concrete.  Air conditioning noisy.,5.0,Quite expensive for what we experienced.
6986,China,,1 night ,March 2019,Group, Bed is confortable, Long queue at reception and breakfast place. Almost everywhere there is a long queue.,4.6,One night stay but felt bad about the service efficiency

Hotel dinning area and bars large and not welcoming",6.7,Pleasant
6990,Belarus,,2 nights ,February 2019,Couple, Location, Staff at the check-in is very unfriendly. Breakfast is quite poor. Rooms are dark with no additional light.,5.0,Next time I will chose another hotel in London.
6991,France,,2 nights ,February 2019,Group," The location is great. 
The concierges were really Nice and helpfull.", Dissapointed  with the room finally it is expensive for what you get. We could hear everything next door.,6.2,dissapointed
6992,United Kingdom,,2 nights ,February 2019,Couple, Location and quality of room good.," Felt very impersonal. Luggage was not in room despite being reassured it would be. Phoned reception and after 40 mins we went down to the reception to help retrieve bags. We received an apology but felt it was poor.
Breakfast was served on Saturday in a large hall which was reminiscent of school dining. Very poor for the price paid. We felt disappointed.
Teas, coffees etc in room very sparce and were not replenished fully requiring us to ask for milk in the eve.",6.2,Pleasant
6993,Malta,,3 nights ,March 2019,Couple,, I got a food poison,6.2,Pleasant

6996,Norway,,3 nights ,December 2018,Couple,," Did pay extra to see the Big Ben from the room, was placed in a room in the opposite direction of Big Ben. Contacted the staff, they told me it was not guaranteed... but I was told in the reception that I would be viable to see Big Ben from the room. Also very dirty windows at the room, could nearly see out to the street.",4.6,Disappointing
6997,United Kingdom,,1 night ,December 2018,Group, It was a modern hotel with good features. The bar was excellent with attentive staff and a band was on that evening who where very good., Gluten free breakfast was not good asked for gluten free bread it was still frozen in the middle. Couldn’t find anyone to take it back. It was a lot of money for literally nothing,6.7,It was a comfortable stay the breakfast left a lot to be desired
6998,Kuwait,,2 nights ,December 2018,Group, Location," Staff over calculated bill and tried to charge for breakfast on the day I checked in (breakfast had finished when I checked in). No apology given. Very confusing explanation of the bill.
Furniture in rooms was old and damaged definitely not 4/5 stars
Same damaged standard was in pool area also
No porter to take bags
Breakfast was limited variety felt like a school canteen.
Did not connect Radisson reward number to stay even requesting this several times.",4.2,Below expectations and I would even say premier inn is better quality and located across the road
6999,United Kingdom,,2 nights ,January 2019,Couple,, Access restricted on New Year's Eve from 2-00 pm due to firework display and wrists band pass system not recognised by street security guards causing massive detours trying to return to the hotel in the afternoon onwards from 2-00 pm,4.2,Overly expensive room charges- don't go there on New Year's Eve
7000,United Kingdom,,1 night ,December 2018,Family, Location is only one good thing i really fancied., Booked a lot of weeks in advance two rooms for family but after 45 mins which i spent in the queue during my arrival they told me my room is not in their system and they offered me way more expansive one which was downgrade for me and they never returned deposit either. Shame for this kind of hotel.,5.0,Fair
7001,United Kingdom,,1 night ,December 2018,Group, Location," Staff service, check in and out were painfully slow. I was kept waiting for a long time.
A lot of the staff couldn't speak English. I speak English clearly and staff just couldn't understand me or looked puzzled, then went off to find other staff members to help! I found this was the case throughout the hotel, whenever i needed help no one could help me, this was in the restaurant, at the bar and also with assistants around the hotel.
The breakfast staff were rude to me. I waited for ages for someone to take my breakfast order, no one did so I had to go up and order two poached eggs which I was then refused as they were too busy and about to stop cooking breakfasts. This was at 10.30 when the breakfast was meant to be served until 11am. There wasn't much room around the table I was sat at because I was sat alone, staff were all around me tidying up previuos guests tables so I couldn't enjoy my breakfast in peace.",3.8,Disappointing
7002,United Kingdom,,1 night ,December 2018,Couple, Great location and reasonable priced car park nearby," Room was very dark and lighting didn’t help . Breakfast poor most hot items were lukewarm and unappetising 
Would Find a nearby cafe next time in town to have breakfast as not worth the money pay.
We were there attending a awards ceremony and food service was good but unfortunately they did not clear the plates from the last course and they were still on the tables at 2am",6.2,Pleasant
7003,United Kingdom,,1 night ,December 2018,Couple, Location only," The room was smaller than expected, and advertising 'city views' should be clear about what floor is allocated.
The material on the chair in front of the TV had worn out around the rim. 
Cob webs around the lights in the bedroom.
The signature wall with the face had not been wiped clean. 
The curtain could not be pulled with the mechanism on the right hand side.
The outside netting/grill on the main window has clearly not been changed/ clean in a very long time.
Somewhat Impersonal check in; no questions about our stay, if we needed directions, information about breakfast, etc",4.6,Disappointing
7004,Ireland,,2 nights ,December 2018,Group,, Customer service was poor from the minute we checked in,6.2,Pleasant
7005,United Kingdom,,2 nights ,December 2018,Couple,, Overall good hotel and we enjoyed our stay. There were some problems due to the fact that the room was under the name of only my partner and not myself so the personnel did not want me to enter the room. (Although I had the email with me). Luckily I managed to change it in booking or I would have had to wait 2 hours in the lobby to wait for my partner.,6.7,Pleasant

7009,Brazil,,3 nights ,November 2018,Solo traveler, Just location is good, The value it’s so expensive to the service at the hotel.,4.6,Disappointing
7010,Ireland,,1 night ,October 2018,Group, Fantastic location - 5-6 mins walk from Waterloo. Facilities were fine and the hotel was spotless. We found the receptionists not friendly and slow (and my colleague had someone else walk into her room after she checked in); and the staff in the bar were not attentive (had to call them over for service). Not good value for the price paid on the basis of the service," Improve the attentiveness, interest and friendliness of staff",6.7,Great location poor staff
7011,Guernsey,,2 nights ,September 2018,Couple, Room was excellent, Poor communication from staff in relation to resolution of complaints. No action taken from complaints. Refusal to deal with complaints,5.8,Okay
7012,United States of America,,5 nights ,September 2018,Couple, Amazing location," The bathroom was extremely small, minimal MINIMAL counter space and the toilet didn’t flush well at all. Had to removed the cover each time to attempt to flush the toilet. Very frustrating by the second day.",6.7,You’re absolutely paying for the location. Hotel is nice but not quite worth the price tag.
7013,United States of America,,6 nights ,August 2018,Family,, Rock hard bed.  Mold in the shower. Location. Horrible perfume/air freshener  smell through out the hotel.,4.6,Will not stay here again
7014,United Kingdom,,1 night ,August 2018,Family, Great facilities and location, Room wasn't very clean. Dust on tables in room. Marks on the taps in the bathroom. Dust on glass in shower. Found a girls headband popping out the side of the sopha bed. Remote for the tv near door wasn't working. Expect the room to be spotless when paying £300 a night,6.7,Good location and facilities but room not very clean
7015,United Arab Emirates,,5 nights ,August 2018,Family, Location, Very poor house keeping and not so friendly staff,5.4,"Ok , room sizes were good"
7016,Russia,,2 nights ,July 2018,Family,," We had a hot drinks station, but on arrival it had only instant coffee, but no tea. I guess it was not refilled for days! The size of the hotel is too big and the staff cannot offer appropriate service to such a big number of guests. 4star, but they don't offer slippers and bathrobe. And on the last day my mobile phone charger was missing. We had a few left on the table and only that particular one was gone. We reported to the security, but no news or update the next day, they simply didn't care. I was offered to go to the business centre to charge my phone, but they didn't have the charger for Samsung edge 8+. And finally they've included a breakfast fee which we didn't have and didn't ask for.",5.8,Okay
7017,United Kingdom,,2 nights ,July 2018,Family, NONE," 1. Price - We paid for more than £100/person every night to get a room with city view(£660for 3ppl and 2 nights), but what we get is at the mid-floor and facing the train station and the nearby hotel room. THAT ‘VIEW’IS COMPLETELY NOT WORTH THAT MUCH MONEY.
2. Service - The receptionist was not welcoming and friendly when we checked in. Her attitude was really bad and made me feel like I was checking in at a one star hotel or even worse.
3. Extra charges - I usually request for a upper floor room, and I added ‘ want a room with better view’(although I booked a room with city view, I have to note that down as I paid that much money just for the view). Please DO NOT request that at this hotel. They will ask you to pay more to guarantee you would get a upper floor room AND the view. If you do not pay for that, you will be allocated to rooms at mid-floor like me with the view of other the hotel rooms. 
 
4. Maintenances - one of the lamps is not working, we put a note on the desk to inform the cleaner that it was not working. They just ignored it. No one came and fixed it before we checked out.
I travelled to many countries and stayed at different hotels. I have to say this would be the worst service and experience I have ever had!!",3.3,I’ll NEVER choose Park plaza hotels again
7018,United Kingdom,,2 nights ,July 2018,Family, Location was good and spa/swimming pool.," Room was not cleaned properly prior to arrival. Dirty carpets, flimsy bed (unlike last time we stayed) and tired furniture.",5.4,Fair
