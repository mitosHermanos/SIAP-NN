Especially Konrad the bar man ( in the restaurant/bar )," The breakfast was poor paid £21 and the food came upstairs cold the toast you couldn’t even call toast it was bread, the sausages tasted cheap, the poached egg cake as if it was microwaved and tasted like rubber the scrabble eggs were watery.

So helpful, friendly and informative. The room which had been upgraded for us by the hotel was exceptional. We stayed in a one bedroom king suite with the view of the Big Ben, River Thames and London Eye. The view was so beautiful at night. Opted in for a few upgrades as it was my partners birthday so went for prosecco on arrival, and the 'celebration package' which included more prosecco in an ice bucket, balloons which were blown up around lounge area and a hand-made cake. Breakfast each morning was hosted in the hotel restaurant and was a english breakfast buffet-style.

Hotel was local to everything which meant we could walk to were we wanted to visit as didnt want to have to use the Tube in current  climate ."," The only two issues we had were firstly with our breakfast ,there was a great choice however because we had to have all our food served to us buffet style we found the hot prepared food was quite cold and you had to wait for certain items ,eg toast .

We also messaged prior to arriving to say it was our anniversary and if we could have something in the room, they said they would add a little suprise but there was nothing.
We were moved from our original hotel, and were slightly disappointed with the standard of room.
The spa not being open was disappointing too which is part of the reason we wanted to stay knowing other places have booking slots available.
Wed like to stay again but at Riverside our first choice Hotel.

I pre arrange a cot before arrival. But when he arrived to his room there was no cot or any bed made up for his daughter. They also discovered the main bed was broken. Reported this to reception who said they would deal with this and visited the room and said the bed could not be fixed. They changed the room and promised a cot as we had dinner arrangements. When we arrived back to the Hotel around 7.30 as my grandson is only 1 they went back to the room to find there was no cot? My son came back to reception to repot this again they said they would get this sorted. After 20 minutes still no cot had arrived. So I asked at reception as it was past my grandsons bed time. They said they wound speak with housekeeping. I did comment that this was the third time we had asked about a cot also it had been pre arranged. They said they would get straight onto it. It took in all over a hour which I found was unacceptable and spoilt the weekend and the surprise birthday with no apologies.,8.8,Excellent

I stayed there for 6 days but my bedsheet wasn't changed! Even after speaking to people at the desk.
It was futile calling housekeeping and get into an arguement with someone there (and I spoke to them quite a few times to ask again and again for face towels and for laundry etc), as almost everyone I spoke to in Housekeeping didn't seem to understand English or in fact even spoke it clearly.

Shame about the grumpy female staff on the front desk of the bar/restaurant who was less than helpful on Friday evening. We had asked for a table and were told to sit anywhere, when we did sit at a table and asked for a menu for food once we'd got drinks with our kids, she got really upset with us, made us get off the table and waved us to the bar area, no other tables available so we went back and asked her to show us to where she meant, and she was less than happy to help show us by walking with us , then shoved 2 tables together, she was really annoyed, as though we were asking just too much, rude!!!",8.8,"2nd stay, some minor blips but good stay."

Last but not least, the tables in the resturants were always felthy and had a bad smell, that was clear to me after I saw how the staff cleans it, a resturant staff member took a dry napcin, spreaded some water on it and draged it on the table with the food leftovers just once and that was it, there were food ubder a few tables that just stood there all the time, that was really bad.",7.1,Good

Lovely Elemis toiletries."," We should have been able to book into our two rooms from 2pm. This was an 80th birthday present for my Dad. We arrived at 3.30pm to a long queue and were then causally informed the room with a river view wouldn’t be ready for a ‘long time’ due to previous guests leaving late. We were told to come back in an hour which is completely unacceptable. Came back after about 40 mins and complained to another receptionist who unfortunately didn’t appear to have a full grasp of English - we seemed to be at cross purposes. I emphasised that there wasn’t going to be a lot of point in booking a room with a view if it was dark by the time we got it, but she just kept reassuring me we would get a room with a view! I offered to clean the room myself as I really wanted my Dad to see the view in daylight. Eventually Mark came to the rescue. He took charge of the situation, and discovered the room we were supposed to have hadn’t even begun to be cleaned. He then moved heaven and earth to get us transferred to the sister half of the hotel and upgraded us to a much better suite and view of the river with the Houses of Parliament. He definitely saved the day and for us the reputation of the hotel. But it had taken an hour and 40 minutes for us to get my Dad into his room, so we weren’t able to fit in a pre-theatre meal.
The only other downsides were no one answered the phone when I had a query late at night - and the next morning the phone kept ringing but there was no one there when I answered it. You have to get all the information about breakfast times/location and the pool from the TV channel - a paper guide would be good, especially for older guests. Breakfast was great for us but by the time we left at 9.10am there was a massive queue - so best to go early.",8.3,Poor first impressions but improved

So we were then in the room & had already shifted table & chairs to make room for twin bed to be shifted to the right. There was only one packet of biscuits in the room & one bottle of water for 2 people.

Also told the view we had in the upgrade was lovely but it was of the hotel opposite, you could nearly see into the room.

The restaurant is very pleasant, overlooking the River Thames and the food was delicious.

We also liked the fact you need to book your time for the pool - so it’s never overcrowded."," It’s a bit of a walk to the closest metro (about 10 minutes) and there’s not much else in the immediate vicinity except a grocery store.

742,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,1 night ,October 2019,Couple, Good quality of the breakfast but not so rich. Classical british breakfast and great quality pan chocolate.," Booking reported the garage; there is no garage but valet parking. It means, £45 and let someone else park your car. In an area like that, it is a very bad lack by Booking.com. I was forced to look for alternative at the very last moment.
The room was ridiculously cold. There was only the possibility to switch on air conditioning. When I asked for clarification to the reception, I was told they could have provided a heater for me. The choice was between the noise of a heater or the silent cold. I do not understand how a four stars hotel has not a heating system available at any time to the guest.
The view from the room was the railway. The room was not supposed to have the view on the river, but what I found was quite poor.",7.9,Cold experience

It just a shame that the same restaurant was so disappointing the next morning.," The issues at breakfast was ridiculous and would probably stop me from going again due to the lack of organisation from the staff and the manager stating ""we have had worse issues than this"". When you return to your table you don't expect people to be sat there and us having to move to another table      and being forgotten about with food on the table but no cutlery and drinks. The table next to us got up to get food and one of the staff removed a chair to take it to another table. Needless to say the couple wasn't happy and had to get a chair themselves from another table.

Tea and coffee facilities were excellent as were the availability of iron/ironing board and in room entertainment
The breakfast selection was excellent and good quality."," Signage around the reception area could be improved as there was no obvious sign for check-in and check-out and there was always a que of people waiting to sign -in with no members of staff available at check-out.
The room was NOT available on our arrival and had to wait approx. 2 hrs, although we were offered a complimentary drink at the bar while we waited.
We asked to extend our check out time to make our homeward journey arrangements easier and although this was catered for we were only given 1 hour complimentary and had to pay for a further 1 hour ourselves, considering our room was delayed on arrival I feel this could have been waivered.
The staff at the bar/dining room could give better communication as to the protocol to follow while in the dining room and bar seating area.
Overall communication was poor, We had to ask questions rather than being explained to by staff on our arrival of certain aspects of the hotel.",8.8,"A fantastic overall experience,but improvements could be made."

When we went down in the evening to get a cab at 18.55, there were no cabs, and a queue ! I complained to staff who went out into the street and eventually hailed a cab.

The safe box didn’t work either. When I entered this room, the room welcomed me with a chestnut lying on the aisle, which led me to questions on whether the room service did their jobs before my arrival.

Was offered access to the executive lounge and one free cocktail but as we were out all day this did not equate with a room with a better view.  Went down and asked again and were given a suite on a higher floor - much better.  Would have appreciated more comfortable chairs so we could relax and enjoy the view.
Neither of the TVs worked properly but this not too much of a problem so did not report it.

Breakfast room was full and was asked to go to a conference room restaurant (with no wondows) whereby still overcrowded and short on plates and breakfast and even had our allocated seats taken due to confusion by staff. 
The fuse in our room went twice because of a faulty hairdryer. I reported it first to cleaning staff, then reception after a 10min wait. After 15min maintenance fixed the fuse but after the second occurrence the receptionist promised a new hairdryer. No hairdryer was brought up. When leaving the hotel I tried to speak to the same receptionist but she asked me to ""wait one minute"" and then checked-in two seperate customers although she was fully aware of the situation. Instead of waiting further we requested a hairdryer from the concierge. After returning from our evening out there was still no replacement hairdryer. 
Furthermore after meeting the duty manager (Mr Salem) I was promised a loyalty membership would be created in my name with enough points to be able to book one night stay in any hotel own by the brand.

We were changed to a room without a view of the river (which we had paid for) but were offered breakfast in the executive lounge for our stay. Throughout out stay however, there was numerous issues which seemed to come down to housekeeping. Hotel staff were happy to help and very polite but no followup from housekeeping was very frustrating. We had to call several times to have any issue resolved. There was a list of things but having our TV not working for the duration for movies (TV stations were working) was annoying and almost the final straw, and whilst staff tried their best to rectify, maintenance and services couldn't get it to work at all and communication between hotel staff and maintenance/outside services was very poor. Another change of room still didn't find the TV working! Concierge was brilliant, very knowledgeable and helpful and I hope the housekeeping services improve as that would have greatly improved our experience.",7.5,Great facilities and location but experiencing numerous issues over our stay was disappointing.

What I lacked in my room was above all a functioning minibar/refrigerator (as a matter of fact, mine was locked and could apparently not be opened for several days even though I twice brought it to the attention of the staff at the reception.

Breakfast was a farce, it was cold and inedible. We helped ourselves from the self service bar, after ordering fried eggs.  We returned to our table and waited and waited for the eggs but they never arrived. After reminding staff at least  3 times, the breakfasts had gone cold, so we are asked if we could have them reheated, the gentleman took them away to reheat, and then after bringing our plates back minus the fried eggs we were told the eggs would be a couple of minutes, so again we waited, guess what no eggs. by this time breakfast was cold again before staff brought our eggs. We couldn't eat the food by now, so did complain to a male member of staff who said he would speak to the manager. We were offered to choose something from the a la Carter menu, which would be free of charge, but there was nothing on this menu that remotely came close to an English breakfast. We cancelled breakfast for Sunday morning as I wasnt prepared to pay another £32 for two breakfasts after the farce we encountered on Saturday morning. This was supposed to be a celebration weekend for our golden wedding anniversary, but it was ruined for us. Suffice it to say, we will  never book to stay at your hotel again.",7.1,Very disappointing

Four other people joined behind me, then after around 10 minutes when i got to the front or the queue an east European Guy decided to jump in front of the people queuing and went to the next available desk. I then said to the guy we are queueing here he said four desks, I said do you think everyone is only queueing for only one of them.

Monday’s hot buffet breakfast was also cold so disappointing. Some of the service for the type of hotel they are trying to be needs to be improved upon with more attention to detail needed. I felt that there was a lot of staff that were new which probably didn’t help. The room itself could also use some more modern touches with the likes of the old design units which need attention used in what is supposed to be a modern technology hotel. The lifts could also do with attention with us being worried we were going to get stuck every time we were in them.,7.5,"Nice hotel, but with it being fairly new, it seems to still have a few teething issues to sort out."

The beds were comfortable, the bathroom and bath products were great. Over all this was a wonderful room on the 7th floor.
We ate breakfast and dinner at the restaurant upstairs. The food was exceptional. At night there was a different talented singer and piano player. We loved the hotel, and the employees especially Don and all of the concierges. Everyone at the hotel did their best to make our stay the best!"," The hop on hop off bus was not what we expected, such as in New Youk, the busses run all day as in LA and other cities. In London the bus stops at 5:00 PM, and we were not told that. If you start at 10:00 in the morning and expect to use the bus until 7:00, find a good restaurant and then take the bus back to your hotel, that is a disappointment. We had to take a cab back to the hotel when the bus stopped in the middle of our route. We won’t use the hop on again in London. We bought a 2 day pass for $80. The second day was horrible too because there was so much traffic we had to wait an hour for the first bus to arrive. We were disappointed with the hop on hop off  based on our other experiences in other cities.

No apology for the accusation. Second example -  staff removed my personal food from the fridge (including unopened packets of food). I phoned and complained. They returned the food after it had been sitting in their staff fridge all day, waiting for someone to eat it! All they could say was ' the housekeeping staff must have though you had checked out' and my response - well, that is a bit odd given my luggage and all personal items were there in the room.",7.5,I bregrudginly stay there due to proximity to a work location.

1938,United Kingdom,Superior Twin Room,2 nights ,December 2018,Solo traveler," Part of the Park Plaza chain of hotels, which all have a similar polished feel with door staff at the entrance. I always try to book a Park Plaza hotel if my budget allows and usually you can get a decent price at either the Riverbank, Waterloo or Westminster Bridge. Although out of the three, I prefer Riverbank, since Waterloo backs onto the train line and Westminster can be very busy, especially at check-in. The rooms are nicely appointed, modern and very clean, check in staff are always friendly and they have a decent gym, pool and room service. I haven't had breakfast here and I imagine it's similar to the other Park Plaza hotels nearby which usually have a good selection of choices. It's also a nice walk along the Thames to my office near Blackfriars which takes about 25mins and also really close to HoP, Westminster Abbey, London Eye etc... all within 20min walk away if you're sight seeing. I definitely recommend."," Nothing, all good!",8.8,"Great Location, clean and modern rooms with friendly and professional staff."

1942,United States of America,Superior Twin Room,2 nights ,December 2018,Solo traveler," Very beautiful hall and restaurant and the overall look at the ground floor
The room was large and clean
Mini bar with many things
Very large and beautiful shower
Large and comfortable bed
Kindness of the people at the reception / front desk
My kid was got there for one night for free :-)
General look"," - the surface of the desk under the glass covering it needed to be cleaned; not a big issue 'cause the glass on it was clean
- the bathroom had few easy, comfortable, convenient bars where to fix the towels 
- an accessory beside the closet was broken and not repaired and not beautiful to be seen 
- the toilet brush was totally absent 
- Impossible to talk by phone from my room phone and with my mobile phone too with the reception; I had to call a lot of other services of the hotel, to wait on line, to hope that some one will call the reception for me and, finally, I had to go by myself till the reception to fix a pair of issues (minibar and a personal request to have a mouse for the notebook)
- the minibar, even if pre-paid at the reception, had to be unlocked when I was in the room; no one answers the phone so I had to dress myself and to go to the ground floor to ask to unlock my minibar
- phone communications not working well
- a person dressed as a member of the hotel staff between the hotel door and the taxi always pretending money whenever you were leaving or coming back to the hotel during the day; I was going out and coming back more times every day and this was boring and really expensive",8.3,if I'll have to be in that part of London I will book again that hotel

The eggs were what I would call 'fake eggs' clearly derived from a processed liquid.  The bacon was almost raw and unchewable.  The bread for toasting was the cheapest type of bread with no flavour and easily burned in the toasting machine.  The whole breakfast eating experience was extremely disappointing.  Having experienced this, it would put me off booking with breakfast again and would also put me off dining in general as there was no care taken in the food prep.

2086,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,1 night ,December 2018,Couple, The ratings reflect my opinion. Overall Excellent.," Just two minor points. First, as an elderly couple we felt that the allocation of the room could have been given a little more thought at reception and not allocated a room with a baby ""Play/Sleep"" cot in it which we could not fold up and place out of the way. It took up too much room, particularly as it was not requested at booking. Second, coming to London for a one night stay it would have been nice to have a room with a view. However, as this was a gift from a sister in law who organised an event, we believe it met all other aspects and requirements. Finally, you could make provision for Coffee/Tea availability in the Reception area. Most elderly people (and disabled people) would like a cuppa after travelling and not have to take escalators, lifts etc to quench a thirst.",9.2,Happy to recommend this hotel to anyone.........with alerts re baby cots and coffee!

We also used taxis a lot to travel to locations further a field, never had to wait for a taxi, there was always a taxi waiting in the hotel taxi parking area. Excellent front of house staff."," The restaurant in the hotel specializes in Asian cuisine. Might need to look else where if Asian cuisine is not to your liking. There is however a good menu selection via room service.
Possibly could use a second bread toasting machine at breakfast to reduce waiting times,

2243,Ireland,Executive Double Room - River View,4 nights ,September 2018,Couple," Perfect place by the river, with stunning views over Westminster. Easy to get to, easy to get connections to everywhere in no time. We took a 10 min bus to Waterloo, then half an hour either direction on the Tube to Wembley on one end and Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park on the other. The hotel was the ideal place to relax after a hard day’s sightseeing and shopping."," One disappointment was the cleaners did not replace the coffee/milk/biscuits each day, leaving my boyfriend with none for our last morning. The bathroom could also do with an upgrade, which I’m assuming they are in the process of doing, given the hammering and drilling coming from the adjoining room.",7.9,Perfect birthday treat

2249,United Kingdom,Executive Double Room - River View,1 night ,September 2018,Couple, The location is perfect! The river room's view. The restaurants.," I paid for a River view room. At midnight (28th-29th Sptember) we had to move rooms because it was freezing cold and the heating did not work, and no heaters were available.
The Reception Manager at night (a lady) told us to wait till she could get a solution. It was nearly 5am and we did not get an answer yet. Poor service. The guy in training (Was it Nahloo? Sorry I don't remember his name), helped us straight away, offered us another a Studio (although it was not river view). He was really helpful and caring. 
We slept just for a couple of hours before going down for breakfast. A couple of hours.
For a 4*/5* hotel, you expect they would take proper care of the guests and not to have them without sleeping till 5am!
It was an important night as we were celebrating Anniversary. It was not as enjoyable as expected, quite disappointed, as I have been another times in this hotel and it was amazing. 
No compensation or apologies offered to us.",7.1,Service not as I was hoping. Lovely looking hotel though.

Beds were comfortable and kettle in the room with coffee and tea supplies was convenient. Not too far from major attractions. For the price, rooms were ok."," Overall our 4 nights stay was ok. However, we reserved 2 rooms. We had no problem with one of them but had issues with the second one. After a long day of sightseeing came back to wet carpet 2 days in a row. Front desk staff were responsive and tried to accommodate by switching rooms. However due to lack of communication between cleaning staff and front desk, ended up moving rooms two times one night and three times another night because the rooms we were moved to had not been cleaned after the last guest.",8.3,Enjoyed rainy London

Breakfast was really, really good with healthy options and not just the usual stuff. Good espresso in the coffee machine. I ordered food from the restaurant twice for dinner and the food was sent to the room very quickly and it was pretty good, with options to have gluten free and dairy free variants."," The staff was at times a bit rude or just not very polite/communicative. A couple of times staff knocked and waited literally 3 seconds before entering - not cool. Cleaning was subpar, could definitely improve considering the overall ""classy vibe"" of the hotel.",8.3,It's a good hotel but staff and cleaning could be better

All of the staff were excellent except for the housekeeper I had to talk with.," Our room was on the side of the train system, so we needed to use ear plugs to be able to sleep at night. The hotel didn’t furnish ear plugs. I accidently  left my iPad in the room and discovered iit 2 days after checkout and we had already left London with no plans to return. I was told my housekeeping that the hotel could not mail my iPad to me even though I offered to pay for shipping. I was told I had to pick up in person or hire a courier service to pick up and mail my iPad. I’ve never been told this ever at 2-3 star hotels, if I left anything behind they would graciously mail me my possession without further requests. I live in the US and our itinerary would not allow us time to go back to London to pick up the iPad,",8.8,Wonderful hotel and wonderful location

The beds are really comfortable. The restaurant is good."," With the exception of the staff in the bar/restaurant and the cleaning lady, the staff were generally unfriendly, unhelpful and had little sense of customer care. There were a series of problems during my stay - for instance being locked out of my room with all my luggage and possessions in it - with the hotel denying I had ever been in that room and insisting I had been in a different room 5 floors higher. When this was eventually sorted out, there was no apology nor any explanation given. Until the point they found I was actually telling the truth, it was as though I was making the matter up to inconvenience them. Some serious training in customer care and service is required. Over the weekend, an event in the hotel - possibly a wedding or christening - descended into violence and chaos that spilled over into the lobby and the immediate outdoor surrounds to the hotel. Lots of police appeared, lots of security staff appeared and after a brief period when it all felt a little unsafe, things settled. Again, no acknowledgement or apologies from the hotel management and reception staff.  Frankly, unless you want to be there for its location, I would avoid this hotel until the service offering improves significantly.",7.1,Great location let down by dreadful customer service.

2335,New Zealand,Superior Double Room,3 nights ,September 2018,Solo traveler," I've stayed here a few times and generally enjoy it as a place to stay: the location is excellent if you enjoy a walk along the scenic Thames each morning on your way to wherever you need to get to in the city. 5 mins to Westminster, 10 to the SouthBank/Festival Hall, 25 to the Strand, 30 to Chelsea. The beds are superbly comfortable. There was a Nespresso machine in the room which worked despite having bits missing."," I paid an additional GBP20/day supplement when I arrived to be ""upgraded"" to an ""executive room"" in order to be able to check in early after a 05:00hrs arrival into Heathrow. The room had no view - it looked into a light well, barely any telephone signal, it had no safety deposit box, no bath, it had marked scuffed walls and a raised lump of flooring about 10 x 15 x 50cm in the floor near the desk that meant you couldn't use the full desk area and in addition I kept stubbing my toes on it. I use my own soap bars in hotels - twice in three days, the soap bar disappeared when the room was being serviced. Having had good experiences here in the past, I'd try it again but it was disappointing on this occasion.",7.1,Great location and the beds are very comfortable - a little disappointed with the room though
2336,Canada,Executive Double Room,3 nights ,September 2018,Group," We arrived earlier than the scheduled checkin time after on overseas flight and the front desk staff were kind enough to let us check in early!

It is also the perfect location to walk to the many of the tourist spots."," The early checkin was great but the room had not been fully cleaned!

I had room service and it always arrived in good time and the food was always hot by the time I received it. Good facilities and good friendly staff, I booked a river view room and even though it did have a view it looked out at trees so the view couldn’t be fully appreciated.  I had a room on the 3rd floor so maybe a room higher would have been better....bit  disappointing as the room charge was for “with river view”. I also had to ring room service for one of “the inclusions” as it wasn’t in my room when I arrived.,9.6,Comfortable with friendly staff

Bed was supremely comfortable and room was spacious. it was a nice surprise to see it was a ""smart"" room, controls by the bed.  It was nice to control the curtains from the bed. 
The hotel is very close to the London Eye, and once you figure out the buses, it's very convenient. There is a stop at the front door which ferries you to Waterloo Station.  
Hotel was always very clean, and we got a free bottle of water and a bottle of wine, plus a little tray of macarons and chocolate upon check in.  Very nice gesture indeed.  I would definitely recommend it."," sporadic sewage smell from the drains in the bathroom. Complained and front desk sent up a plumber immediately.  The smell went away, but came back periodically. In the end I just shut the bathroom door. It was ok since I was mostly out of the room, but there was a definite plumbing issue. 
Also the bathroom lights automatically shut off after a predetermined time. Twice was in the shower and the bathroom went completely dark. this is pretty disconcerting not to mention dangerous.   I forgot to mention this to front desk .
There are only a few dining options within walking distance, so better to have your meals before going back to the hotel for the night.  The hotel is actually on a rather industrial block.",9.2,"Convenient, clean, modern hotel with good service.  Can't ask for better.  Size of room excellent."

2457,Ireland,Executive Double Room - River View,2 nights ,August 2018,Couple," The room was really big for what I would expect of a central location in London. 
Great views (obviously paying for it - room with river view).
Good location (in front of Westminster area). 
Really comfortable mattress."," Working for years in hospitality, regretfully I must say that our trip was not was I would expect from a 4 star hotel.
It was a special occasion and I requested prior check in what I consider a fair and simple request: to leave a note in the bedroom upon arrival and a room with bath. What is my surprise when at check in, there is no notification received even thought the several emails sent (via booking.com and directly to the property). This said, I would like to personally thank Monica (I believe this was her name if I remember correctly), as she was extremely nice and professional, and she reassured that at least we got the room with the bath. Due to the lack of preparation of my two requests (and even though I really appreciated her work, the room was not cleaned upon arrival and there was dust all over the furniture - not a severe case, but I am allergic to dust & thankfully this was more or less solved the morning after). We received later on some macaroons in the room, I believe thanks to Monica too - Italian speaker - great attention to detail.
I must say that we also got a room in a floor where some maintenance work was getting done, therefore we could find dust, paint, and dirtiness all over the hall, and experienced some maintenance noises during early hours of the morning.
The room did not have a proper table for having breakfast (one chair on a working desk and one sofa with a bed table), which is a shame, taking into consideration the wonderful views and the potential guest experience, so it was not really comfortable or nice to use and pay for the room service (plus, I would like to mention that I personally find ridiculous to charge 21 pounds for a breakfast that is consisted in literally 6 pieces of food - it is weird to provide with a full selection of marmalade but no bread or bun or whatever to spread it...).",7.1,Good
2458,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,3 nights ,August 2018,Couple, Nice hotel apart from queuing for breakfast sun morning.

Great view of the Houses of Parliament from room 1086.
We found the security staff on entry to the hotel friendly and warming. 
Facilities clean although on arrival there was trays outside rooms littering the corridor from breakfast (it was 2pm!)"," Staff were cold, unapologetic and the hotel was dated.... the room was decorated with cold leather and outdated hotel facilities. 
In the river view room there was no English plug sockets by the beds for phone charging and the lighting was extremely dark, even with all the curtains drawn. The Bed was ok... not the standard expecting. 
On arrival we informed the staff that the riverbank has been closed for sometime so they should take it off booking.com. It is incredibly misleading to offer a hotel when it’s closed. Completely unacceptable. 
On check out, the staff let a lady push in front of us even though we had been waiting for 10 minutes patiently. Then on complaint they said ‘oh you should just put your key in the bowl...’ no sign to say to do so...
£150 deposit taken for hotel which is in the ‘terms and conditions’... this should be sent in a clear communication beforehand. 
Parking a complete mess outside, difficult to negotiate walking around them.
Single use plastics still be used - this hotel is definitely in need of a makeover and better management. 
Lots of people entering the hotel and walking around with no masks.... felt a little uncomfortable at times as to whether the hotel was taking our health and safety seriously.

2553,United Kingdom,One-Bedroom Suite with Kitchenette and Balcony - River View,2 nights ,July 2020,Couple," The terrace and balcony are great with nice but basic garden furniture out there. The view is great.
The breakfast menu is good because you have lots of options just beware the quality isn't up to much.
The bed is very comfy and the bathroom clean with a decent sized shower."," ****** THIS REVIEW IS FOR PARK PLAZA WESTMINSTER, THE RIVERBANK HOTEL WAS NOT READY SO WE WERE MOVED.******
I paid for a suite and received a glorified hall way that could just about fit a bed in... We were sold this as an upgrade from the room I had booked.
I included breakfast in the booking... On the first day this breakfast was an hour late, cutting into our day. When I called down to see why it was an hour late and where it was the staff member was combative as if we had somehow done something wrong to make the breakfast late.
I instructed her that it would be good manners to apologise rather than try and blame us for their obvious failings and she all of a sudden found her customer service hat again and went and sorted it.
When it arrived it was cold and it got even colder as they sent it up to us without any forks which isn't ideal for tackling scrambled eggs and beans.
When I called down for the forks I mentioned it would be rather cheeky of them for that breakfast to remain on the bill nonetheless it did, they obviously see that as satisfactory service.
This was room 1542, if they offer you this room in the guise of a ""suite"" do not accept it. It's a very narrow odd shaped room and the only decent thing about it is the terrace and the view which at night is brilliant.
Check in and check out both bang average.... I had no photo id on me at check in and so the guy made a big deal of it and basically tried to make out he was doing me a favour letting me stay there for the £450 I was paying for 2 nights.
On check out we weren't even asked how our stay was which is just as well really because I'd probably still be there now.
We were up on the top floor, with the room being so small and narrow we were obviously going to want to enjoy the terrace.... To do this you have to drag yourself down 15 floors again to fill out a form and get a key.... Because naturally they couldn't have mentioned this at check in!!",3.0,Underwhelmed is an understatement.

The room was changed around 12:40 in the morning !!  We were very tired, and although the air conditioning in the room that was replaced by us was not different from the first room, as the air conditioning was making a disturbing sound we had to sleep because of the extreme tirednes.

I asked why - ""It's our policy for all booking.com customers"". I also said I wanted a receipt on departure. ""We can't give you one because you booked through booking.com"". I'd had the same problem last week and in the end emailed booking.com, who emailed Park Plaza, who emailed me a receipt.  What a waste of eveveryone's time!  So I persisted (""It's not our policy"") and said I had eventually got one from the previous week (""Well that's not how I've been trained"").  The Asst Manager came out.... ""It's not our policy, we can't do it because the rate you pay is different from our agreed price with booking.com"".  So I showed him last week's invoice - which showed exactly the same amount!  He grudgingly agreed they would provide one on departure (which they did).  Later I went to the bar to get something to eat.  The Maitre d' greeted me and told me to sit anywhere.  The one free table (for 2) was in the window, set for food, so I sat down.  Within 30 seconds he was back telling me I couldn't sit there, that was for the restaurant menu, I'd have to sit at the bar.  So I moved to the bar and he brought me the bar menu.  Then ignored me.  As did the other waiting staff.  I eventually spoke to a passing waitress..... ""I'll get one of the bar staff to take your order"".  Nothing.  Eventually after nearly half an hour I decided there were more deserving places to spend my money so I went to the burger bar under the railway arches down the road where the service was a million times better than this so-called 4-star hotel.

We paid for the superior room to incorporate breakfast for an extra £25 as opposed to £22.50 each if you paid separately at the hotel, we found the breakfast awful!!! The bacon was congealed together and tasted very strange? There was also some insipid sausage along with some bland scrambled eggs, the hash brown was nice but the beans tasted of an inferior nature to a ‘standard’ type. There were only plates at the warm buffet so after queueing at the continental section, because the cooked breakfast was inedible, we had to go round again after fetching a plate because they didn’t have any there. We had to wait for ten minutes for one of the rare waiters to fetch a small jug to put milk in for our tea and coffee, when we did get some the coffee was like sludge and not very nice so went for the machine version and dutifully queued with 6 other guests for one o the machines whilst a similar number queued for the other machine, getting down the last two we were then told the machine had stopped working so had to join the back of the other queue!!! I decided to have a latte and a cappuccino but upon returning couldn’t taste any difference between the two as they were both really poor. My advice would be to not bother with breakfast as it was really bust and definitely not worth the wait, go out and find somewhere else. My last moan is we were unceremoniously woken at 03:45 in the morning by someone trying to get into the room opposite by tapping, banging, slapping and shouting to the occupant all to no avail, in the end I had to tell him to go down to reception to get them to attract the attention of whoever he was cohabiting with.

We had tickets for the London eye so I thought I’d sort that out later when we got back! We then went out to explore London! We returned home after a long day at about 9.30pm and I checked with reception to see if the bed had been made! They said go up to your room and we will send housekeeping up with the bedding! We went up to room 1547 to find our keys didn’t work so rather than lug my 8 year old back downstairs my husband went down to tell reception! In the meantime housekeeping came to make up the bed! He used his key to get into room 1547 to find a man come to the door in his pants who said our luggage had been taken back down to concierge and this was now his room and his children were asleep! He said to me “you had Disney cases, they were taken back to concierge!” Julian the housekeeping manager heard all this and then took us back down to reception where another concierge man found our bags and said the guest in our room didn’t see our bags but he clearly had cos the guest told me I had Disney bags so he’d seen them! And we had valuables in the bags which if he wasn’t an honest person he could have taken our belongings including an iPad! 
We were now in reception with a very tired 8 year old with no room! The receptionist gave us a new room 1641 which we went all the way up to to find no bed for my little boy just a double bed and a table! This room was a smaller room than 1547 and no room to fit a bed! We rang down to reception to tell them and they kept saying we will send the bedding up! There was no bed to put the bedding on! Julian then arrived with said bedding and said he had no beds to fit in that room but he could squeeze a camp bed in! I went back down to reception to see if there was another room but they said they were fully booked!",1.0,Terrible

A surcharge of 50 pounds per person per night was the fee for that.In total 500 for rooftop bar and 280 for breakfast equaling 780 in extras for a 5 night stay.

And breakfast menu was unhealthy and venue was very dirty. They show me a table which was very dirty under and around.

2745,United Kingdom,Executive Twin Room,2 nights ,September 2019,Family, Good location and convenient position for what we wanted to do., The staff were unhelpful as many could not speak English and could not respond to simple queries. Our coffee machine was broken and took 2 days and 6 staff to sort it out. Quite noisy from other rooms. No door to the bathroom was unnerving to older companion. Decor is dark and lowly lit so difficult for older companion to move around. Facilities in room are controlled by electronic keypad and ok for younger people to master but older person struggled.

There were trays and empty bottles in the hallway to our room. We had a good view of the river and I feel that we paid for it. We could smell cigarette smoke in our room and I complained and nothing was done. Not bad for a non smoking room. The housekeeping staff could have done a better job of cleaning up the crumbs that were on the floor. I got a bill for 3 breakfast days but only had the chance to eat 2.

The sad part is they do not refill the items. You have to pay for the omelettes ! Most of the restaurants in the UK serve free omelettes during the breakfast. However, they serve fried eggs if you have the patience to wait. Keep in mind, you will have to stand in the queue if you arrive after 9am.

The room service from the night before wasn’t taken out during cleaning of the room. The location was nice as it was on the water and close to some of the attractions: London Eye and Westminster. However, it was lacking in restaurants and cafes which made it difficult to search for places after a long day of sightseeing. During a late night attempt to go to the hotel restaurant- chino Latino- we were told we cannot order what we wanted, that we had to choose a pre fixed food option even though the place was empty. My parents ordered room service and no one called them back to say they had to use the late menu so would never receive the order anyway.

However, we were offered a voucher for the hotel bar. When we came back from our schedule for that day at 11pm and got to the room, it clearly wasn't vacuumed. We told staff directly then and again after breakfast the next morning, but in the afternoon, the same dirt (there was a red heart-shaped sequin) had only been moved around in the room. Also, they had removed our used towels but only replaced one of them. Beauty products weren't stocked up, used water glasses weren't replaced. The elevators are a disaster, there are only two of them and it takes ages for them to arrive and then again ages to get to the desired floor. Breakfast is to be taken in the bar at very low tables, and the range and quality is the poorest I have encountered so far. There was a bowl with grapefruit segments which were hardly recognisable as grapefruit, it was only a gooey mass. The air-conditioning in the room blows down straight onto the face, so we had to have it switched off at night.

2866,Ireland,Executive Twin Room,5 nights ,May 2019,Solo traveler, I went for breakfast on the first morning of my stay only to be met by a tour group of approximately 50 people who were completely blocking all access to the food and eventually I had to leave (without breakfast) as I was going to miss my bus. ALL guests should have been accommodated with breakfast. As a result of this I decided to order breakfast to my room on the second morning and duly filled out my breakfast card and left on my door handle the previous evening to be collected. When I opened my door on the second morning to see if anyone was on the way with my breakfast lo and behold my card was still on my door handle and had not been collected by anyone! This is not good enough., The staff at reception and concierge desks seem to have serious difficulty understanding simple instructions in plain English. I ordered a car transfer through the hotel for Heathrow Airport on my final day and when I asked the front desk if my car was outside at the allotted time your employee checked outside and told me that it was not. He then rang the car company who told him that the car was in fact waiting outside the hotel. The driver of said car then came to the front desk and reminded your employee that only 15 minutes beforehand he had approached him and made his presence known! How could your employee have forgotten this in such a short space of time.,4.6,WAY over-priced for the quality of service provided

Why we were targeted like that is beyond me and particularly annoying given the two times we attempted to use the bar, we were completely ignored and just left without being served.

Check in process was ok, however we were pointed towards the wrong set of elevators. We spent a good 3 mins trying to find the room. During this time we asked for directions to our room from the housekeeping personnel that were around. The first 2 spoke zero english, she kept talking to us in spanish i believe. Finally a male member of staff was able to assist, pointing us in the right direction. Upon entering our room, we noticed that bathroom had not been cleaned. Towels & toiletries were changed , however there were multiple stains on the floor and the wall just by the toilet (looked like piss). The carpet was not hoovered (bits of food) and the hard floor had foot prints and dirty marks. We called reception and was told someone would come up. The lady who came up told us that the ?pee (stains) could not be cleaned, she did not acknowledge the dirty carpet & hard floor despite us pointing it out, she was incredibly rude and not at all professional. We went downstairs to complain, only to be told that house keeping would clean the room in an hour or 2. We asked for a room change which fortunately they agreed to. Suffice to say it was evident that the cleanliness and attention to detail was incredibly lacking for this hotel coz the 2nd room was clearly not well cleaned either (although the bathroom was better, no pee stains). Day 2 of our stay, we woke up to a cold room with the ac blowing cold air despite being set at the max of 28C. I rang reception and an engineer came up. He fiddled with the ac for about 30mins following which he said if it doesnt get warm in 10mins then it would be a ""big job"".

The ""view"" was a grey block of flats next to us, with no view of the city/river, and there were 4 tiny macaroons for us as a ""special welcome"".

The mini bar although fitted as standard in the room, it wasn't made clear that it's contents were chargeable and therefore after consuming some of the items, upon check out we were surprised with a high charge. The breakfast was cold and the waiters/waitresses were not on point, we were offered tea but never received and our used plates, cups, etc were still left at our table until we left the restaurant.",6.7,Mother's day stay

2926,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,2 nights ,March 2019,Couple," My mum and dad enjoyed the food. They had fillet steak and said it was
beautiful. The wine is a bit pricey 125ml is £9, but this was a special
occasion, so the price didn't matter."," This was bought as a Christmas present for my mum and dad. It was also
their 40th wedding anniversary. I gave you special instructions of this
special occasion and they did have a note. I also called the hotel prior
to their stay and they advised something would be complementary. Your
website advised that a small deposit would guarantee the booking. 2 days
after booking, they took the whole amount. I manually updated the
details to my mum and dads name as advised by yourselves. When I called
the hotel they wanted another full payment from myself and this would be
refunded back to me within 5-10 working days. I have an email as proof.
They put them on the 13th floor with a view of the building. I am very
disappointed with the service and the complementary surprise. There was
no hair dryer in the room, which I find very strange, even the most
basic hotels have these facilities. They got the bill at the end of
their stay, which had £145.00 added for using the mini bar. They never
took anything from the mini bar. This was a clerical error. For being a
very favourable hotel, there was no bathrobes or slippers either. I have
my husbands mum and dad going this weekend. I'm not looking forward
to their feedback after their stay. I would not recommend this sister
hotel to anyone. Cheaper priced other Park Plaza hotels are much loved
and have everything you require for a memorable special occasion. I
regret totally booking this hotel.",5.8,A bad choice of hotel

2929,Kuwait,Deluxe King Room with River View,3 nights ,March 2019,Couple, the location was good and nice view," My partner did upgrade for the suite through phone because it was my birthday as a surprise after I booked in booking but when we arrived there they had no idea about it so it was poor communication and system also my partner paid for VIP reservation service so we can do early check-in and do special treatment for us and good services but unfortunately they didn't let us in early check in and we waited from 10 am till 2:30 pm ! Also the staff were too rude to us and they don't smile at all
the cleanliness was terrible they didn't clean for 3 days the suite ! they cleaned the toilet only but and rest of the suite was a mess and dirty and the bed sheets was the same for the whole stay it was dirty and they didn't changed it too nasty and the cake we ate and the finished bottle and glasses of wine they didn't pick it up for 3 days was there and they didn't clean the living room it was messy and dirty
also they charged us on meals and drinks that we haven't order !! and then they found out that there was someone took our name and orders food on our room number and our name so it's means there was breach of information between staff other wise how come someone random oder food and drinks on our NAME AND ROOM NUMBER how he knew that secret information if it wasn't breach from the system or staff and how come they have poor security that they allowed random person to order food on our name without checking if he was real guest or a thief  !!!! so the security there was terrible
also the second day they stole my adopter I left it in the bed and came back I couldn't find it.we told them and instead of apologizing or giving us a new one and checking with the room service to investigate they were too rude to us and told us to do police report if we want !",3.8,it was terrible experience I would never ever come back to this hotel again !

The room we were moved (also on 15th floor) to had marks all over the walls and floor in the bathroom as if it had never been wiped or cleaned, along with a brown ""smear"" above the toilet roll holder. The concierge simply advised us to put some water on the shower wall and see if it improved. This caused a bad smell. I tried closing the shower down and it jammed. The next day we were moved to another room, which seemed fine. We later noticed a hole in the bedding, hairs under the pillow, a broken toilet seat and all the pillows were rock hard. Upon pointing this out to the so called Guest relations manager they wrote the issues down, and wrote ""NBTD"" at the bottom, (nothing better to do).........I returned to reception with another request, only to overhear them slagging us off and insinuating we were ""playing them"" and ""playing games"" and ""after something""........""he wants something from us"" etc etc. I then speak to the management the next day, and specifically asked for the General manager and received fob off, after fob off after fob off. A staff member also described us as ""very difficult"" right under our noses to other guests, however he did so in French, unluckily for him I speak the language, and when I challenged him he claimed they were speaking about football.........We were told General manager would be available at 3pm, we say we will be back by 3pm to speak to him, when we ask for him, the front of house manager tries to suggest we said 5pm not 3pm......I then go down at 5pm and he isn't available.........We ended up with uncomfortable pillows, a broken toilet seat, and a generally unclean room, and staff that just kept on insulting us quite frankly.

Good having coffee and tea facilities."," Only had a partial river view which disappointed us. Unfortunately a baby was crying for a lot of the night in another room, and we did not sleep very well because of that. We had no hairdryer in the room and phoned reception to acquire one. We were going to have breakfast, but did not want a full English breakfast and would have preferred e.g. just eggs florentine which would have meant an additional cost. Also not a very personal service when you have to queue for your own tea and coffee.We therefore did not stay for breakfast.

You in fact took £100 which was processed and taken from my account. Why was this done when the bill was already paid and no damages or outstanding items where incurred. We requested an upgrade and was told that it was not available. We heard another member of staff asking someone else if they wanted to upgrade. When I rang the hotel on 26/02/2019 about the £100 being taken from my account I was promised a call back.

The location is perfect for my work, the hotel is stylish and usually clean and the staff are usually very helpful."," I had arrived at the hotel at around 16:30 after a very gruelling almost 14hr long haul flight and all I wanted to do was get some sleep. Even though im a Radisson Gold card holder I had to wait for almost 20 mins to get to the check-in desk at reception only to find that the room, which was supposed to be ready to check-in to at 14:00 was not ready and was informed by the staff I would have to wait for 1 - 2 hours before the room was ready for me. At that point I was so tired that I could barely keep my eyes open and the only thing that was offered to me is the reception staff told me they would keep my luggage for me while I waited. Ive just gotten off a very long flight I was exhausted, where was I supposed to wait, was I expected to sit in a seat in the lobby or aimlessly walk round London exhausted while they prepared my room. Id booked a room with a river view and in the end I ended up having to stay in a lesser priced room with no river view and the bathroom smelled as if it hadn't been cleaned properly. The apology I received, at reception for this was hardy convincing. The following morning I discovered the the reason why the room hadn't been ready, the previous day, when I left my room for work, ensuring the ""please clean my room light was illuminated"" the cleaning staff where stood in the corridor less than four rooms away gossiping. I arrived back after being away for over three hours and the room hadn't been clean. I was still suffering from jet lag so I just went to my room so I could sleep again. I later phoned reception to ask for some fresh towels, I've now checked out of the room, three days have gone by and im still waiting for those towels. Ive stayed in the hotel numerous times and never had a problem before but I can assure you I will think very strongly about staying there again.

This was matched by the demeanour of the staff who were either not interested in taking any responsibility for our stay or didn’t listen to issues that were raised. Poor arrangements for breakfast meant that some tables were knee high so causing clients to almost bend double while eating, also there was little healthy choice and items which would usually be included ( omelettes, eggs Benedict, kippers) had an additional fee. It was a bit of a scrum too as there was not really adequate space for the number of guests. The room was small with the twin beds pushed together ..cramped feeling and incredibly warm.

When we came back around 3PM we checked into our room, however the bathroom door would not shut at all! We were confused as to how the house keeping didn't notice this when cleaning / servicing the room? It must have been noticed as it was stuck and wouldn't even slide half way! Or maybe it was noticed but they just didn't think people would care?! Very awkward if you would go to the toilet with the door wide open if you ask me! We rung up reception about this and stated someone either needs to fix it or we will have to move rooms (as we had plans for the afternoon) we didn't want it to waste our time. 40 Minutes and 4 phone calls later - a maintenance guy finally decided to arrive! After he was unable to fix or shut the door he then had the cheek to say ""are you sure it was like this when you arrived"" VERY rude! we had literally just checked into the room, went to go toilet and couldn't shut the door! Cannot believe he tried to accuse guests like that!! We then heard him call reception and say "" I will be able to fix it but it will take quite a while"" So the reception rang us and said they will move us rooms and call us back in a few minutes time - 10 minutes later no call.. so we took matters in our own hands and went out of our way to take our luggage and go down to reception. We then spoke to a manager who stated he will be moving us rooms, he was very professional and finally we felt like someone actually cared!",6.7,Quite unsure of this Hotel

I was told only booking.com could correct the mistake. When I got put through, they supposedly couldn’t get through to the hotel and consequently, I had to pay £50 to change my booking.
Be warned, I spent an hour trying to correct their mistake but to no avail, best bit; I just got my UK mobile phone bill and they’ve charged me £30 for the calls... Not once was I told the number was premium rate.

2994,Switzerland,Superior Double Room,2 nights ,November 2018,Solo traveler," Not much.
We changed rooms 3 times as the first 2 were in the middle of a renovation and there were tools on the floor in the corridor and the whole etage smelt of paint.
The second 2 rooms on the 8th floor, one had water drippjng through the ceiling and smelt of smoke, in the other there was something wrong with the air conditioning and the room was like a sauna. We complained to the manager who was very nice and actually upgraded us, but it was still very time consuming.
The drinks in the bar were exorbitant, 11 pounds for a small aperol spritz, no crisps or nuts either. You couldn't get a coffee in the bar before 11 oclock if you were not having breakfast which was both ridiculous and very annoying as because  the hotel isn't very central we had to walk for about 30 minutes to find somewhere.
Then to top it all on the second night of our stay the fire alarm went off at 22.45, which was extreemly frightening as we were on the 14th floor.When we arrived outside in bare feet and dressinggowns we were told by a guy smoking outside the hotel that it was a false alarm...... no one from reception apologised or gave us any explanation which we found atrocious, we returned to our rooms rather worried and as you can imagine we didn't sleep very well.
We were all really disappointed with lots of things, the reception gave us no information of where anything was when we checked in, so I think they definitely need some training in customer relations.
Most of the staff didn't acknowlege you in the corridors which isn't very  good either.

The room had a sloping ceiling meaning I could not stand up in either corner. There was only one small floor window, and an 'artificial' window next to it which was just a light panel with curtains across. I felt extremely claustrophobic.

3061,United Kingdom,Superior Twin Room,1 night ,September 2018,Family, Booked a room for my partner and I and requested a cot for my 14 month old baby ahead of booking. This was confirmed. Checked in 2pm and the cot was not in the room. A travel cot was bought in with some old sweets in it. Small problem - it had no mattress! After a debate about child safety and a mattress we left for a few hours. The manager promised to resolve it prior to us coming back and to phone. No phone call! We got back to the room and the travel cot had been lined with towels by head of house keeping! Apparently no mattresses are provided and no one has ever complained before. It took till 7pm to have to move rooms and I had to sleep with the baby in the bed and ensure he did not fall out! They did give us complementary room service but I would have preferred a safe place for my baby to sleep! Cleanliness in rooms was not great either. On a positive note the location is great and the swimming pool! Staff need training as it was like the computer says NO! The hotel is not suitable for young children., All of the above!,5.4,Fair

3065,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,1 night ,September 2018,Solo traveler, I've stayed at this hotel before principally due to its location to planned business meetings and it is very adequate for this purpose being right by the river and within easy walking distance of Westminster/Whitehall. The rooms are well designed and comfortable with the appropriate amount of space for working. I opted for a superior room which had a good sized desk which was perfect for working in the room.," Considering the detail of the Room Service Menu, the product was rubbish. I don't know whether the kitchen was understaffed, not working, not bothered or all three but the food was tepid and lacked taste.

Nice view along the river, which is ideal for walking and just steps away from the hotel."," We asked for a quiet room and were on the train track side of the hotel (something like 7 tracks run along the Waterloo line right behind the hotel) - which was remarkably loud at first - you get used to it after a while, but that first night was tough; it was clear that the room was not vacuumed once during 4 days there; the air conditioning vents are only in the front room - no air circulation in the bedroom at all (it was hot & humid during our visit).

I would try to use the clippers from here next time!," We had arrived at the hotel, but the room was not ready so we left and then returned a couple of hours later to check in.  The hotel did allow us to leave our bags which was helpful.  I have been a little disappointed as once we were in our room as the chambermaid came to see if the room was clean, which I would expect to have been completed prior to being given the key.  I then checked the room myself and found there to be rubbish in the bin, the bed appeared to be remade not freshly made and the bathroom was not new guest ready either.

Great location - not too close to the centre with all the noise but within walking distance or short tube ride to the main attractions."," We arrived early for check in and thought we would see if our rooms were ready yet. We were advised that if we wanted the two rooms on the same floor then only one room was ready but we were welcome to use that room to drop our bags and return at the regular check in time to get the keys for the second room which we were happy to do as we wanted rooms on the same floor. We returned 45 mins after the regular check in time to be given keys to a room on a different floor so we queried this with the member of staff who seemed a little confused and spoke to the other girl who we had dealt with earlier on the afternoon. We stood there while the girl tried making some phone calls but appeared to get no answer, she advised us that the second room was still not ready and asked us to wait as she walked off which we assumed was to go and check the room. 10-15 mins later she returned and handed us a key without much of an apology for our wait or an explanation.  Air con/ heating in the rooms is a little noisy which didn’t really bother me but may be a little annoying for light sleepers. Also you could only access the mini fridge if you left your card details at reception which is a little annoying if you just wanted to add your own drinks to the fridge to keep them chilled.",7.5,Hotel is modern with a perfect location for sightseeing.

It was really important for me to have a good hotel and luckily I found this hotel. I saw some bad reviews too, but I had a positive impression after all. I was really hoping that this hotel would meet my expectations and it did! I didn’t regret my choice even for a second! Staff was very friendly and they helped us to fix all of our issues promptly."," The sink got clogged, but this issue was fixed very fast, the room wasn’t cleaned that day for some reason, but they sent us a written apology.What didn’t like at all was that we couldn’t use the mini fridge to put our food in there, it was locked, and I couldn’t buy my fave cheese. 
Also, we asked for two separate beds, but they were place very close to each other so they basically were one bed. However hotel personnel came and put two beds separately.

3299,United Kingdom,,2 nights ,April 2019,Couple, Very modern hotel with excellent facilities and location.," Everything with the actual hotel and location was perfect however on arrival we were met at the hotel reception by a very rude receptionist.
We were very confused whilst checking in and instead of making this more clear by politely explaining the safety deposit and how much was due etc, the manager just aggressively shouted that we have not paid and we must pay now.
Not the best customer service skills especially when we were being served initially by a trainee receptionist - what type of example is this showing her? 
Apart from this our stay was really pleasant.",9.2,"Great hotel, rude receptionist."
3300,United Kingdom,,1 night ,April 2019,Couple," good location, great breakfast eggs cooked to order and great poached eggs", in bedroom lamps look like they have been removed and replaced with a circular piece of plastic in the headboard and white tape in bathroom holding above sink unit,8.3,Very Good

3302,Australia,,2 nights ,April 2019,Group, Most of the staff were amazing and helpful.," We asked for a twin share however on arrival beds were together and there was furniture in the way so I tried to ring reception about it. Rang a number of times and no one picked up. So had to go down. They assured me someone would be straight up. 3 hours later still no one had come. This happened two more times and no one ever picked up the call from the room, so each time had to go down  before the room ladies would arrive who had told reception they had done it. When they arrived they made a comment and gave us a look like we could have done it ourselves even though beds were heavy and there was other furniture to move out the way, and we had been told not to do it ourselves. This part of stay wasted time and was a poor start and meant we couldnt relax . The Safe also didn’t work so had to get maintenance. Then was delivered a report from someone after 9pm acknowledging our complaint but it was not our complaint  so must have been a mix up with another room. The girls on front counter were excellent trying to sort the issue however the room cleaning staff I felt were not listening to them. We were compensated for the mess up.",7.9,Lovely facilities and rooms and very handy.

We booked two twin rooms; upon check in was told we had one twin and one double executive. No big deal, the front desk lady made the change easy. When each pair went to their rooms everything was great until we met up back in the lobby. Room 2 ladies (room 405, I was in room 432) said their bellman Roman or something like that gave them a quick overview of the room; he showed them how to use the remote panel, gave them extra bottled water and ordered two robes and slippers. Our bellman guy did nothing like that and never mentioned that we shouldn’t drink the hotel faucet water. Room 405 was nice and cool; 432 was always hot even with the AC set to the lowest level. The other person in my room had a cold shower, even though she was the first to shower. My shower, about 30 mins later, was nice and hot.

The staff wrote me a card to wish me luck for my big event the next day and I was very thankful."," The first room I was offered had super low ceilings and the bathroom was not really clean, the second had no openable window and the furniture was also not clean. The third, was lovely, the only drawback being that there was no single electrical outlet in the bathroom where there was a mirror, nor was there any outlet in front of any mirror in the whole room. Only one side of the bed offered an electrical outlet. The heat on that level of the hotel was not controllable in the rooms because it was older and offered one setting for the whole floor.

Calling reception took a while but when they did eventually answer they did act promptly to try and resolve the situation. 
Although breakfast was lavish, there are not enough tables so you have to queue to get in.

On returning my call ten minutes later they asked if I could come to collect it. When I asked if I they could post it to me.

-incompetent, inexperienced reception staff.
-dim, gloomy lobby and reception area and lifts.
- booking requests not adhered to and little effort to accommodate us with better. Initially, instead of a river view, we found ourselves facing a brick wall.
A general lack of maintenance in the room with severe limitations of products: shaving mirror fixture broken, so unusable; bathroom mirror so poorly cleaned we had the impression it was steamed up ; only 1 bath gel and shampoo, i.e. enough for 1 shower for 2 people (we wanted to take a shower in the evening and in the morning, so insufficient supply), idem for tea and coffee, just 2 packets of everything.

Guest services could not tell me when it would be arranged yet we had to put out child to sleep. Only on a personal visit to reception did they then, 30 mins later, sort the bed.

Toes nails on bathroom floors, previous guests t-shirt left in cupboard, loose crisps lying in drawers. Floor not hoovered, sticky surfaces, balloons from previous guests hanging round the lamps, filthy teaspoons and cups. Also, I got my poached eggs 20 minutes after the friend got hers. They yolks were solid. They brought me new  eggs but this time there was a hair on my plate. Staff at reception moved us to a second and then a third  room but I have no confidence that anything was going to be done about our complaints in terms of feedback  to those that could improve in the future.",5.0,Disappointing
3447,Norway,,3 nights ,September 2019,Family,," Did unfortunately not meet our expectations. We had a family room, however the extra bed was made for one person only, although we had booked for two kids. We had to notify the reception twice before they finally came with extra bedsheets for the second night. Air condition was leaking water down to the carpet on the floor, we got wet every time we accidentally stepped into it. Nothing was done to fix this during our stay. Lack of info at check-in: no info about wifi, breakfast time, checkout time - we thought we would find this info in the room or on the keycard folder, but no. At check-in we asked about opening hours for the swimming pool and also if there were specific times for kids to swim. We were not told that we actually had to book a time slot for swimming in advance, this came to our knowledge when we came down to the swimming pool, ready to take bath... Breakfast was chaotic and unorganised. Sorry, all in all we expected more from this hotel.",5.0,Fair
3448,United Kingdom,,2 nights ,August 2019,Group, The Beds were very comfortable. Reception & porters very helpful & friendly., The children were very disappointed that the pool was closed. We booked this hotel for that facility.,6.7,Pleasant
3449,United Kingdom,,1 night ,August 2019,Solo traveler," I liked the central console for lights, curtains etc."," Admittedly I  booked my room on the day but it wasn’t discounted and was at the going rate, I was not advised that there was a train line directly outside my window and at the same height.  The trains were constant, particularly in the morning and despite double glazing were noisy.  I booked thinking there was parking, which it says on the booking page, however reading the small print after realised they didn’t have parking other than valet parking.
Breakfast was chaos.  The hotel was extremely busy with tourists and there was a queue for breakfast.  I sat at the bar as I was on business but it was bedlam with everyone bumping into each other that I jus5 had toast and a coffee.  It certainly wasn’t relaxing and there was an air of unhappiness in there.",6.7,Chaotic hotel with a busy train line at the back
3450,Australia,,7 nights ,August 2019,Family, Location wasn't  too bad.," Had a room with a bath but couldn't  use it because the bath plug wouldn't  seal.

3451,Australia,,3 nights ,August 2019,Couple, Good location," The toilet bowl was cracked. The design of the shower is poor, the glass doors are floor to ceiling. Lack of ventilation has lead to a mouldy ceiling as the steam has nowhere to go. The aircon was dripping onto the carpet in front of bathroom door.

3454,Germany,,6 nights ,July 2019,Family, The river view is great and the bed is comfortable. Aircon worked well.," Service, in particular housekeeping, is not up to standard. They seem to have organizational problems. Our room was not really clean: dusty, breadcrumbs and dirty mugs from previous guests. In addition, everyday something different got forgotten: towels, shampoo, toilet paper or coffee utilities weren't replaced. A promised linen change never happened. I complained during my stay, staff was friendly, but nothing changed. At check-out, they charged double breakfast although we only had booked it for one day. I travel a lot, for work and for leisure - I haven't been so dissatisfied with a 4 star hotel in a long time.",4.2,Lack of housekeeping and service-orientation

The free wifi was good and location is convenient especially if you like to walk to Westminster, the London EYE and Borough Market environs. The staff at check in/out were wonderful especially Jeffrey who went out of his way to provide an excellent service."," I did not like the fact that the shower had mould in the grouting. It was a bit of a let down for the rest of the room. What I did not like even more is the restaurant staff. They seem to be more interested in doing their job rather than serving customers. I spend a lot of time choosing items from the menu at the restaurant which I dined at and after clearly explaining to the waiter that I had a restricted diet, he failed to point out that two of the dishes I ordered had the ingredients I was trying to avoid. I returned one dish and tailored the other to my requirements by removing the unwanted batter from the fried fish. I wish he paid more attention and recommended other dishes which are more suitable. During breakfast, I did not like the limited dishes. They could do with more fruit and vegetables and a less micro managing Manager. I felt sorry for the staff working there. The same could be said about housekeeping. I had a late check out and the privacy sign outside my room switched on but housekeeping barged in without knocking before I was due to leave the room and practically kicked me out!",6.2,Good hotel. Shame about the restaurant and housekeeping staff!

We had to go back up the stairs and out through the bar. Thank fully it was a false alarm but the situation would have been much more serious if there had been a fire. This was a serious breach of fire safety regulations. The evacuation was also not handled well by the staff. I have put in a complaint about this.,5.4,Good until the fire evacuation which breached regulations.

Nobody turned up. I had to call twice more and after twenty minutes went back down to reception so so could actually have their attention and some customer service.

I PRE-PAID for the ENTIRE cost of the room before arriving, but was made to pay the entire bill again (instead of just the food charges incurred) when checking out. I tried to explain i had paid already when my assistant booked the room, but front desk staff was insistent and I needed to get into the office for an early meeting. Upon further investigation later with my bank, it appears the hotel ALSO put a full-value hold on my cc for the room, in spite of the fact that i paid in advance AND then paid at the end. I vacated the room on 30 Aug and there was a hold STILL on my account (after 2 payments to them) on 4 Sept. Whether it was due to incompetence or maliciousness, i don't know, but i don't really care. My ability to function financially in the city on business this week has been severely impacted by the Park Plaza Riverbank and their inability to prevent, proactively fix, or even try to make right the theft of my money is disgusting.
