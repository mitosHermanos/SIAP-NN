It wasnt a cheap room, but we got fabulous service"," Everything was superb but for one thing. My daughters bed was a fold down sofa and that in itself was fine. However,  she found a half eaten packet of popcorn and some contents below her bed with other bits of rubbish so it doesnt look like the bed is ever put back to a sofa or they dont check it. Either way  it was disappointing as the quality of the room and facilities were so lovely and you dont expect to pay for lack of care!
Only other comment is the full English breakfast at £19.50 each is way too high. Especially as we went to premier inn (a 2 minute walk around the corner) for 2 adults and 1 child for £21 for us all.

The room was upgraded to a suite on the 8th floor which was very comfortable & compact with a small kitchenette.

Clean and comfortable room."," The hotel has some refurbishment work taking place which affects the front entrance. We received notice of this from the hotel about 1 week before arrival - but this should really have been explained at the time of booking as we might have chosen to book elsewhere.
The Bar area was very disappointing. We hoped for a comfortable area to sit, relax and enjoy a cocktail - however it seemed to be an overflow area from the dining room, with formal seating around dining tables. I guess this is linked to the refurbishment work taking place.
Our room was generally fine, but a few signs of wear and tear. Stains on the carpet, fittings missing in the bathroom and bedroom (holes in walls where they have obviously been removed). Carpet in the hallway outside our room was worn and torn in places. Not the type of high quality environment you expect from a hotel of this level/cost.

However, there is also looooads of other stuff to do around that area. There are several streetfood stands and plenty of small stores to browse around."," The breakfast was absolute terrible!
The scramble eggs tasted like rice pudding and had nothing to do with scramble eggs .. Can't even be bothered to describe the rest of the breakfast, just that it was terrible and only got even worse on our last day there (which was TODAY).
On top of that they offered us a ""GO GREEN"" voucher in return of not using the roomservice (so they told us), they never mentioned anything about skipping 2 days of cleaning as well - This is just poor service and lack of informations about their services and offers they provide.
Also, we ordered roomservice the first night there because of our son (3½ years old) who was tired after a long trip from Denmark - I CANNOT recommend doing so - They charge you premium price for a mediocre meal, so go somewhere else to by your food.
I wish we did not have to experience all these things, since the hotel itself really impressed us.",7.1,Good

This meant the restaurant s were crammed full of tables, their seemed to be insufficient staff, which meant they were running around, stressed, agitated, which then is felt by the guests. The breakfast price is also way overpriced, with things like smoothies additional to the 19.50 already charged, which is ridiculous. For a start who eats 19.50 worth of cereal and croissants? Or add in a couple of sausages and beans, still worth only half of that. Also I've never had to queue for a breakfast table in any restaurant I've stayed in throughout the world, crammed into a small corridor outside the lifts.

I ordered a simple Steak and Chips. When it arrive with no presentation of garnish and just a pot of English Mustard and asked very nicely, could I get a sauce such as a Béarnaise sauce? The Server looked at me blankly and said GRAVY? She went and asked the Chef and return with a NO, so I asked for French Mustard, they had none. She then came back again and said you did ask for Hollandaise? I said no and why would anyone ask for Hollandaise with a steak.
There were four people in the restaurant and your chef couldn't whisk two eggs, a dash of lemon juice and vinegar together? but they all can Che k their phones and have a laugh and push each other around in the kitchen in the view of me.
Also, if you ask for a Glass of white wine and ask for a second glass , I would expect there to be continuity in your glasses, two completely different glasses were given , with two different sized white wines in them??
I ask that you use staff who are the face of your hotel,  to have a basic knowledge and grasp of English and the menu.

1236,South Africa,Studio Double (Family),9 nights ,December 2018,Family," The location is excellent. It backs onto Waterloo station  underground and overland trains. The Gatwick Express arrives at this station and the hotel is about a 200m walk from it. Staying South also helps with navigating the underground as most of the attractions is North of you. 
A simple stroll right onto the Southbank and into the centre of Westminister, a Marks and Spencer just around the corner and the beautiful double decker buses parked out in front give it a very pleasant feel. The hotel is very child friendly (many little perks to make your stay enjoyable.) 
The bar area and breakfast dining area are comfortable, but only if you arrive EARLY for breakfast. The line gets very long and the staff stressed."," I found the staff not well-trained, miscommunicating and contradictory. 
The front desk staff at points were very rude and abrupt. English is not their first language and they struggle to communicate. Right from the check-in the promises were not delivered on. They would become very defensive if questioned about it treating one as if you’re a fool when they didn’t know and implement procedures correctly. 
The bar area is understaffed and on multiple occasions I had little to 0 service. On one weekend evening the bar was packed with only one bar tender serving the patrons. I waited more than 30 minutes to be served. This did not improve later in the week either. 
I got a sense that staff is not very happy at this venue which results in their abruptness. One chef at breakfast was specifically rude and disrespectful. I also witnessed him having issues with co-employees on multiple occasions. At one point he dropped a heated pan on the floor in the eating area. His reaction was very blasé. Really not the kind of person you want to represent your business. 
Due to the poor communication and discrepancies I picked up I specifically requested a detailed statement to be emailed to me on departure, which is still outstanding😞I can’t say that I expected Guillermo to deliver when I requested it as he did the check-in too.",7.1,"Great location, but staff training and morale need to be improved dramatically."

I then ordered 2 for 1 cocktails prices at £11.50 and was then asked to pay £12.94 I asked why the price difference to which he told me was for service charge. Despite being served drinks at the bar?

The breakfast was good and even at peak time the queue wasn't too long.", The room felt cramped and there was only a view into the side of another building (OK for a short business trip I suppose). The lifts were slow during peak times (I decided after 5 minutes of waiting to use the stairs down from the 6th floor).

The lighting in the bathroom is not good enough for women to do make-up or general face care! There is no right plug inside the bathroom to use electric Hair dressing devices. The TV had been in a bit awkward place to watch from bed. The telephone had a non stop blinking red light which shows voicemails but i could access them or stop that light from blinking.,9.2,Wonderful

1333,United Kingdom,Studio Double (Family),2 nights ,November 2018,Family, The family studio was ideal for travelling with young children - there were 2 televisions too which meant no fight over channels!  The staff throughout were kind and helpful.," Room was very hot in the night and the air-conditioning was both noisy and ineffective.
At breakfast time families were sent to use a conference room on the 1st floor - it was dark and ugly and the cooked food was cold.  The mushrooms with the cooked breakfast were the worst I have had in my whole life.
They had put up a poor quality projector showing Toy Story with the sound turned down - perhaps this was considered compensation....

1438,Spain,Superior Twin Room,3 nights ,September 2018,Family," Gary in concierge was so helpful in finding our rucksack that we forgot in a black cab on our last day, he literarily made our stay unforgettable!   Can not thank him enough for going through all the trouble of helping us.  We had 2 bedrooms on the 13th floor, one facing Thames with incredible views over the city, which we loved ( except for the dirty fridge).  The other one faced the hotels indoor patio with view over the inside restaurant and was disappointing.  You felt as in a closed of box.  But highly recommend paying a little extra for a room with a view.  Also the service at the bar was excellent, the girl who served us coffee on the 24th of september at around 2 o´clock (unfortunately can´t remember her name) was beyond helpful.  And can I mention Gary again?  He is the crown jewel of this hotel!"," The breakfast: not much variety, very expensive ( 19 pounds per person per day and 16,5 pounds if you buy for your whole stay).

1461,United Kingdom,Executive Studio - City View,1 night ,September 2018,Group," Extremely clean and comfortable. Great location. Staff very helpful. On the negative at breakfast the tables are really jammed in together so difficult to move around, very noisy. The people next to us were face timing someone with their tablet- not using headphones so you could hear both sides of the conversation. Personally I find this extremely rude and two sets of people moved from their table as a result. I think people should be actively discouraged from doing this- they can use their room. On a Sunday morning at breakfast I do not want to be hearing someone’s business phone call."," As above- no face timing in the restaurant- it’s inappropriate and spoils the experience for everyone else. The maitre d saw and heard them do it, heard me saying it was extremely rude but chose to ignore it, even when two couples said they wanted another table because they didn’t want to sit next to them.",9.5,"Enjoyed the room and the facilities within it.

1545,Canada,Studio Double Room,7 nights ,August 2018,Group," If you're in the area for sightseeing, the hotel is located very close to the London Eye, Westminster Abbey, the Palace of Westminster and the Churchill War Rooms; however, if you're more interested in doing some laid-back, local activities, you're also a short walk away from a handful of really great pubs and restaurants (we particularly liked The Three Stags and The Pineapple). Finding transit from the PPCH was easy as it's very close to Waterloo Station, where you can catch a number of buses, trains and the tube.
The layout of our room (u-shaped, with a bathroom and kitchenette in the middle) made it easy to share the space with my friend while still maintaining a degree of privacy. I also made a special request to surprise my friend and the staff went above and beyond to help me out. They even left a sweet and very heartfelt card for us, which we really appreciated."," There were some small details that detracted from how otherwise lovely the room was (stains on the lampshade and on sheets that had just been changed). Also, the internet was not always entirely reliable on our floor. Finally, for food, the bread pudding that we received for room service was amazing but the pie and cake that we also ordered was comparatively tasteless. 
If you want a hotel that's cozy and nice for families, I would strongly suggest the PPCH *but,* if you're looking to stay somewhere that seems a little more hip and youthful, the PP Westminster Bridge (which is just across the street) would probably be a better bet for you.",8.8,Well furnished and location can't be beat

Location is perfect for exploring London and easy to get around with Waterloo underground station very close by.
Wifi all around the hotel was fast."," This hotel has one giant problem. It has an open floor plan with a big open atrium in the middle and all rooms forming a circle around that space. The elevators have an open design and open up to this atrium as well with their backs.
The problem is, that the elevators make an extremely loud clanking noise whenever any of the 3 elevator moves. This would be tolerable if you could only hear this while using them, but since all rooms are facing them and there is a huge open atrium that magnifies this clanking noise you get to hear this noise from anywhere in your room, including your bed.
If you try to get to sleep at 11pm, good luck, it sounds like a person is standing in the front of your door clanking metal together every 10 seconds. 
We were only able to get to sleep with earplugs in, which is totally unacceptable for a hotel in this price range. 
Providing a quite environment at least at night is one of the bare necessities a hotel should provide.
I would not book here again due to this.",3.0,"No sleep without earplugs due to loud clanking noise from elevators every 10 seconds, even at night."

Breakfast took 15mins before we could be seated. Never have I had to wait and I travel extensively all over the globe.
If you can accommodate so many guests, make sure the breakfast area is large enough for all to be seated.
Secondly, lifts are ridiculous, we waited nearly15mins again and queue was building up yet lift just goes,past our floor (11the), eventually arrived and even then we had to squash in.
Breakfast we were seated in the small section where hardly anything was available, lack of teabags, stock not replenished, I ended up buying breakfast from around the corner which was worth it. Unlike hotel option.

There is no longer a guest laundry, despite what is on the property’s website. The rooms are getting tired with things like cabinetry not fitting properly, cracked tiles etc. A constant annoyance was the room keys which regularly ‘deactivate’ requiring a trip back downstairs to the ever-busy reception to be ‘reactivated’. There are simply not enough elevators for the number of guests in the hotel during peak times resulting in a long waiting time to get your bag downstairs when checking out.

Despite asking for a high floor as it was my husband's  80th birthday (we booked a Junior Suite) we were on the lowest floor for that room category (8th) so had a lovely view of the building opposite and half the London Eye.

I had to pay double the price since it was New Years!! ( around £4000 to see partial view) Upon arrival I realized the whole thing was a complete scam with false advertising & the ladies at the reception became quite defensive and wanted hands-off on the matter claiming “they’re only working there and they’re not to be held countable”. 
I requested to speak to the manager who didn’t want to do much first but after seeing how upset I was in the reception, barking “false advertising” and uncovering shameful reality I was finally given the chance to cancel my booking (which was made impossible at first). 
The manager became softer towards the end and even called us a cab. After 8 months of planning We were left completely devastated & disappointed in putting our trust in this hotel!!

1762,United Kingdom,Superior Twin Room,11 nights ,December 2018,Couple, The reception staff were warm and friendly. door staff were helpfull, The Hotel was full booked which we expected but the facilities are far too small to accomodate this. Breakfast was a nighmare - rushed to eat meal and clear tables - not enough space between tables so was constantly knocked or bumped into.  The room was not cleaned to the standard we have usually been used to when stopping here - I had to ask constantly for clean towels - not were left in room after cleaning on several occasions- floor was dirty from last guest - did not replenish teas or coffes and also had to ask - cleaning staff were miserable and stuggled to understand what I was asking for.  Guests children were running riot down the corridors and were playing in the lifts - spilling drinks and food on the floor.,5.8,nice xmas with family but would not stay again - this has disapointed us as we have stayed many time

Reception and room service staff friendly, but not matched in the dining room."," No help on arrival from the doorman as I struggled to get through the revolving door with 3 bags. The room service food was absolutely awful, just the worse I have ever had. Breakfast wasn’t much better - surly chef who used hands for the ingredients for the omelette making rather than spoons, the waiting area for eggs was also not well organised as it prevented others getting to the buffet. Lack of bread and roll choices for breakfast. The seating was also very unorganised as we were made to wait when there were plenty of free tables. Continued to watch this debacle when I sat down surrounded by empty tables while they may people queue for breakfast unnecessarily. Bath shower combination meant you had to climb into the shower. Not a nice view from the room and could hear noise from other guests in the corridor when in room. Clattering from the breakfast area on the ground floor travelled to through the central courtyard and woke you up early. Nowhere outside for drop off by taxi or car and the nearby car park has no lift if you have a heavy case.  Would choose to stay somewhere else next time - probably the Premier Inn immediately round the corner unless the negatives are tended to.",5.4,Wouldn’t stay again.....

We booked a superior double room but when we checked in we were given a standard room.  We asked to be moved and were moved to a room where the bathroom plumbing leaked so badly it flooded the bathroom and where the air conditioning was faulty and only pumped out freezing air - in November. A maintenance engineer came and couldn’t do anything.  We weren’t even given extra towels or blankets- and all for £420.  What a rip off.  Reception wouldn’t even note the complaint and customer service is so poor they will only offer a discount off a future stay - as if we’d ever stay in this dump again!,3.8,Awful - avoid at all costs

Do not waste your money on a Penthouse. 
The mini bar had an old packet of somebody elses opened olives in it and no other refreshments.  We paid a lot of money to stay in some luxury and did not get the treat away that we looked forward to and feel we deserved.

My husband wasted a good 50 minutes having to go back to the front desk to sort the prepayment of the bank card only to find the mini bar was empty anyway (apart from those lovely olives of course ) 
We also ordered some snacks in the form of calamari and chicken wings, both of which arrived cold and the calamari undercooked. Quite a poor show from a supposedly top class hotel.

The curtain to close this window is smaller than the window size, which means...you won’t be able to close it! 
The bath water is not hot enough, if it during winter it makes impossible to shower. Also no door to the bath area , which makes the whole  bathroom wet!

1842,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room with London Eye View,1 night ,August 2018,Couple, The view in our upgraded room was amazing," I’d originally booked a superior room which was actually very similar to a premier inn room and quite pokey and I only had a partial view of the London eye which I had especially paid for so I asked for a room change and was only able to get an upgrade which cost a further £70 on top of the £238 which I had already paid, this was a Birthday treat for my husband but must say all the extra expense did put a dampener on our trip",5.8,Okay

1845,United Kingdom,Penthouse Suite (Family),1 night ,August 2018,Couple, Penthouse suites have nice views of the city," Hotel is looking tired in places, and the service wasn’t great. Usually service is outstanding and I wouldn’t ever consider staying elsewhere. But this trip has me thinking otherwise. We had to wait around a lot, almost 40min to check into our room, 1.5hrs after check in opened, as our room wasn’t ready. Whilst we waited in the bar it took almost 15 minutes to get two drinks, the bar was not busy and 4 members of staff were in the bar. So much so it took for a manger to come in and say something to have them move. 
Glasses from room service were dirty so we used the ones in the room instead. 
We opted for breakfast in the room due to being in the penthouse as we wanted to enjoy the view during breakfast, we had numerous items missing from our ordered breakfast even though there was a written order form... over all not the service that we have come to love and expect. Disappointed.",6.7,Standards have slipped. Quite disappointed this time round
1846,United Kingdom,Executive Studio - City View,1 night ,August 2018,Family, Poor management from the moment of check in everyone seemed unhappy to even be there and what it looked like Managers just looking important where in reality doing nothing.

1847,United Arab Emirates,Executive Studio - City View,4 nights ,August 2018,Family, The bar guys," Just a quick review(check-in of the hotel) check in: they were bad at dealing with me, (room service): good at times and some times bad,) the most annoying thing about my staying in the hotel is the operation manager (James Doherty) because he accusation me and my elder mother with smoking in the room in the End he Enter Our Room And he go Around the Room didn’t find anything after that he Go out without saying Sorry is that how you treat your guest.? The only thing that make me passionate Every day about that hotel is only the bar guys, check-out:(Rebecca from room service-she charge us 150 for something we didn’t do

They were always extremely helpful with luggage, taxis, etc."," The marketing for the Penthouse was way off!  The online pics showed a beautiful room.  Our first room was dirty and cramped.  I complained and they moved us next door to another dirty room but had a small amount more room.  The carpet had stains, there were holes in the curtains, a hole in the ceiling about the shower and just overall bad.  I don't think these rooms have been inspected by management for some time.  Lastly, after someone came to open our balcony door, we couldn't lock it again so it stayed open all night.",5.8,"Very, very disappointed."
1850,United Kingdom,Executive Studio - City View,1 night ,August 2018,Family, Beds and bathroom samples good," Had to hold the bath plug by hand to empty it, as there were 3 of us wanting a bath and soak our tied feet it took 2hrs. Bathroom sink did not drain when brushing teeth so once again took longer. Have stayed here in March and loved it but the bathroom plumbing let it down. I mentioned it to hotel lobby who did apologise.",6.7,Pleasant
1851,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,1 night ,August 2018,Couple," Good selection of food for breakfast & hotel was in a great location, only minutes walk from Waterloo."," Had to queue for about 10 minutes to be seated for breakfast - very small seating area considering the size of the hotel. No cuttlery on the tables so some people were having to wait to eat until more was brought from the kitchen. Only 1 small coffee machine to use which dispensed 1 cup at a time, which meant another queue to get a cup of coffee. Surely jugs of filter coffee in addition to this would have made more sense, again for such a large hotel it was as if they were expecting hardly any guests for breakfast. By the time i got to eat my breakfast after queuing for a hot drink, it was cold! I wouldn't have been happy if i'd have paid separately for breakfast however on this occasion it did come with the room.
Over-all I don't feel the hotel stay was worth what i paid - £242 for the night. I think you are probably paying for the location more than anything else! The room was a little disappointing even though it was supposedly an upgrade from a superior double to a executive room - i'm glad i didn't pay extra for this initially when booking. For the price paid i would have expected a much better standard and over-all experience. I would say this is more of a good 3/3.5 hotel than a 'luxury 4 star hotel' as the description says.",6.7,A little disappointing for £242 per night!

Every member of staff had a smile for you and went out of their way to acknowledge you. The breakfast staff were unbelievable.  Nothing was too much trouble, they were cheerful, efficient and a wonderful waiter actually bought Almond drink for me as a substitute for milk when I asked if they had it.  The breakfast was exceptional, any combination of food from continental, full English plus full English veggie, porridge, yogurts, fresh fruit, you name it. Perfect poached eggs are NOT easy but on two mornings mine were spot on! The Manager was superb as were the waiting staff.  
We forgot to ask for a change of towels one morning or request a room clean but on our return late in the evening clean towels and a fresh supply of coffee and milk were delivered to our room within fifteen minutes of asking.  Cannot fault any of the staff and the Manager of the hotel should be very proud of them! The hotel is just around the corner from The Eye/Thames/South Bank and Westminster Bridge and Waterloo Station and underground are a few minutes walk away.  There is also an M & S food outlet within two minutes and a Boots. I have never returned to a hotel in London before but I will return to this one."," If I HAD to say something negative and it is what I say for many hotels.

Being a young couple I feel as if when we checked in due to not seeming a wealthy older couple we were palmed off with quite possibly the worst room in the hotel.

Also as stated our floor was under construction and the first thing you saw when coming out of the elevator was the site office with people sitting around dirty with their feet up.
