137,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,2 nights ,August 2020,Couple," Given the current climate, it’s great that the property was clean and they had tapes labelled with sanitised...around the wardrobe, phone and toilet seat which you had to rip to use. This put you at ease slightly. Staff extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Bed comfortable and clean. 
The location was great if you want to in the city centre and do a spot of shopping or eating/drinking."," Given the property was in the city centre, the downfall of this is that there seem to be a lot of party goers potentially staying here. On our first night we could hear our neighbours making love and headboard banging the wall which did not allow us to get much sleep on the first night. On the second night some drunken people were opposite our room and were arguing into the early hours in the the corridor and banging doors which also gave us another sleepless night the following night. 
The parking situation is also not the best as you have to walk about 7/8mins to the nearest car park. There is a bridge that you walk under to get to this and it’s rather filthy with pigeon droppings etc. Also you see a lot of drunken people in the area after hours when returning to the hotel from car park. Not very pleasant if you’ve been out into the early hours and returning home. There is also a reduced price of £14 to park at the car park which can be quite costly if staying for a long period.",8.0,Great location

The room as comfortable and clean, we had an amazing view of Leeds especially at night time!"," The only fault was that after our stay we fancied a little shop around Leeds and at check out we asked to leave our cases for an hour or two, the lady behind the desk decided not to let us keep them there as ‘people will be bringing cases soon before they check in, and it will get too full’. It wasn’t said in a polite way and it felt like as soon as we checked out we were ditched and the staff could be no longer helpful or accommodating. I think when your charging £109 a night then you can hold two small cases for at least an hour. We then dragged our cases round the shops irritating other shoppers as we went around. This is our second stay at the hotel we recommended all our family and friends but now we’re not sure we want to come back.",7.0,Stylish and comfortable.. but not accommodating!

Our room was an executive double and really wasn't an impressive room, the only reason it was  value you for money as it was reduced. But what ever the price you pay on the day the expectation of the room should be of the same quality.

And one of us has a heart condition so unable to climb stairs. Staff seemed to ignore or  it acknowledge the trouble we were all having. 
When entering the room the bed looked fantastic it was really big as advertised to our disappointment it was two mattresses pushed together great if your sharing a bed with mates but we went as a couple. Both woke up with bad backs due to constant sliding of the mattresses and falling down the gap. For these two reasons I wouldn’t stay here again. Which is a shame because it could be a great hotel.

My colleague was charged £10 at reception for breakfast. When I asked to pay for mine ( we checked in at the same time) I was told to sort it out in the morning- which I did but was then charged £10.95 for the same breakfast. 
We then found out that we were only allowed the continental breakfast which was cereal  and pastry. It was no bother really but it seemed odd that the option wasn’t there. Also not sure why my breakfast was 95p dearer?!?

After calling reception hoping they may move us to a less noisy room or provide ear plugs, they weren't that helpful. They offered us a late check out which wasn't what we needed or wanted. Having previously stayed in the Park Plaza on many occasions in the past it really disappointed.",8.3,Disruptive and unhelpful staff.

I understand that maintenance is essential, however, why were we not told about this BEFORE our stay!!! At check in the lady on the desk informed us. Too late to make other arrangements. 
I received a message from the hotel on booking and not once did it mentor the work being carried out. We had 4 builders literally outside our window crashing and banging about from 8am. I could hear all their conversations. Why on earth with so many floors in that hotel did we get placed on the exact spot they were working?! Money grabbing at its worst. 
The room itself was a little disappointing too. We opted for the superior double but I fail to see what was superior about it. Combine that with the fact we paid more for a spot in the midst of the building work I’m quite annoyed. 
I think had we been informed of the work before our stay I could forgive it but the choice to withhold that info means we’ll not be returning.",6.7,"Uncomfortable bed, small superior room and building work made for an unpleasant stay."

She took my bag early too she was lovely!"," I stayed here last year for Leeds pride, my outfit for pride was a harness and shorts, as much as I appreciate that it wasnt the best choice of outfits, the night door staff didn't make me feel welcome , multiple judgemental looks and an attitude that was rude and felt against LGBT. Reason for this feeling was I walked past him in a hoody and shorts shortly after and he was friendly. It was the choice of my outfit that made him rude.
I witnessed him being rude to another resident to the point where this gentleman kicked off as he headed towards the elevator. 
I think some members of staff could do with being more friendly to all and not just to who they choose to.",9.6,Lgbt pride

The men could see into my room and it went on all afternoon banging and the lift moving up and down. I appreciate works need doing but I should have been informed prior to my arrival so I could decide if I should stay or change hotel.

Despite the staff trying their best to put us in a room at the opposite end to where the work was being done, we were still woken up on the Saturday morning to continuous banging.

Unfortunately during our stay we were on floor 19 where building work was taking place. The work started at 8.00 in the morning and the screeching sound of the drill was exceptionally loud. Surprisingly this stopped by 9.00 two days running.
Considering most guests would have been out until late I find this rather frustrating.

By at 3.50 they told us it would be about 10 more minutes so I waited. Then at 4.05pm I started to worry I was going to be really late so I had to get washed and changed in the bar toilets. Exta uncomfortable being that I am 7 months pregnant trying to negotiate a small cubicle! I Then I had to leave my husband and 3 year old daughter in the hotel reception. My 3 year old was already getting impatient and bored of waiting. She had already endured a 40 minute drive to get to Leeds. Many other customers arrived after us and were able to go straight through, which slightly bugged me too.
In the end my husband and child got into our room at 4.40pm. 1 hour 40 minutes after the room was supposed to be available. And over an hours wait from the time we arrived. They apologised and gave us a free breakfast in the morning but it didn't make up for spoilt plans and the mummy guilt of having to leave my child unsettled.
On another note, there was only one pillow for each of us in the room. At the minute I need 3 to have a good night's sleep. 2 for my head and one for the baby bump! Because of this it wasn't a good night's sleep.

Inclusion of a small fridge was great for storing our baby’s milk.
The staff were pleasant and helpful when asked questions."," I’ve been coming here for a few years and usually everything is excellent but this year the room felt less clean and polished than previously, including a flickering light bulb which eventually failed and mould all over the bathroom sealant. Also, we returned on the second day to find that whilst the mugs and tea had been replaced and the bedding tidied the loo seat had been left up with urine in the bowl (which we did not do) and the glasses had not been replaced, as if someone had only half finished the tidy-up. Small things, but not nice to find someone else has used the toilet. 
We had asked for a travel cot for our 2 month old before arriving, but it came dirty and with a mattress like wood so we didn’t risk him in it, using our basinet instead.
The lifts were frequently being used by housekeeping services, making it difficult to fit the buggy in and they were literally falling apart with a wall panel missing from one of them.
Usually these little things wouldn’t bother me but all together it felt substandard this year, which isn’t great as it was more expensive. Hopefully things will improve before thinking about our stay next year!",7.1,Less polished than usual

The bathroom was new and well equipped"," The bathroom entrance was from the bedroom. It had an opaque glass door and there was a closet just in front of this door.

This is normally my go to hotels everytime i come to leeds"," There has been 2 occasions in the last couple months or so that i have stayed at this site iv never normally had any issues with park plaza as i always swear by the service and hotel. But my last two stays one of the staff members have made my experience pretty difficult and i find him very rude and not pleasant at all. I had booked 3 separate rooms for 6 friends as we are aware we cannot stay in a room with more than 2 people so being sensible i had booked 3 rooms so we would not get in trouble. When paying for the 3rd room the staff member and security was making me and my friends feel very intimated saying if he finds out we are in a room with more than two people he would kick us out. There was no need for him to be rude and speak to us like this as we was sensible to book 3 rooms for 6 people therefore we would have gone on our night out and returns to our rooms and left at checkout the following morning. Also his security guards were very disrespectful to me and my friends for no reason when all we wanted to do was check in.
Now the second time i stayed was for a work occasion as i needed to book a place closest to Arlington offices whiterose park as i have meetings that following morning but due to covid i had gone back home which was in denton manchester so i got my employer to send me confirmation that it was a work reason for me to be staying at plaza i also rang the reception and a nice lady confirmed that with the confirmation from work i could go ahead and book in and show proof at reception so i booked it in. When i got there the lady was not there and again i had the same staff member who bullied me with his security last time serving me and my husband who had drove me 2 hours down from denton as i do not drive. When i got there again it felt as if i was being bullied and intimated by this staff who was rude and not welcoming at all.",4.0,Disappointing

Made my stay so awful so I spent most of the hours outside anyway luckily it was booked right near Trinity shooing centre but it shouldn’t have been like that.

When we checked in i asked about the birthday plate was reassured I can have it. I also asked for extra towels as we traveled from London so didn't want to use the same towels in the evening and extra hot chocolate packets. They said it's fine will send it to our room later. Checked in no iron had to ask for one. Hair dryer wasn't working. We went out and then came back late to our room and they wasn't no towels or hot chocolate.

There should be a mirror by the door instead of only in the bathroom.
It would be nice to have an actually queen bed instead of pushing two single beds together. Me and my wife couldn't even sleep next to each other because we were sinking down the middle - we had to sleep as if we had our own individual single beds
The hotel was advertised to have parking. In actual fact, there was an independent car park they were associated with which means they do not have parking - so they shouldn't advertise the hotel as if it is their own.

We checked in at 3.30pm had 2 rooms as we were 2 couples .  1 of our rooms wasn't ready, which was fine as we put all our bags in the room that was and due to sanitisation...we understood cleaning could take longer. We paid in full for both rooms when checking in. 
Then later in the day I got a call asking if I still required the 2nd room??? Well yes of course we do.....and we've paid for it! 
Then we came back to the hotel bar for drinks around 11.30pm. And had to explain to security why we only had 1 room card. We then got our 2nd room card after a little ordeal. 
When we went to the bar, the barman struggled to understand our order. His English wasn't the Best!! Gave us the wrong things! 
On our way to bed, i just asked the receptionist what time breakfast was......to then be told that we should have booked a breakfast slot?? Why wasn't we told this at check in?? At what point do you do this??  We got offered a 8.30am slot or 12pm. ? 
I wasn't happy as neither of these times were suitable! But more annoyed that we hadnt been told. Anyway eventually he managed to ""squeeze us in at 10.30am""  
I feel there was a breakdown in communication between reception staff And guests.   And I feel that the hotel was trying to let my allocated paid  room to someone else!!

This really made me feel stupid and I wasn’t going to write a review but I feel that in the current climate nobody should be made to feel stupid for protecting themselves and others by simply wearing a mask.

So I’d had to sit and wait in the foyer despite having a confirmed booking code I could present to the hotel. 
The room was scruffy. The bathroom had someone else’s dark hair strewn over the shower knob. Dust everywhere. Curtains heavily stained. Room was claimed to be sanitised. I actually moved rooms Twice and was told I was unable to move rooms again, and was at first put into a disabled room which i found odd. 
The towels were scruffy and had evidence of someone else’s makeup and a brown colour of which I found out later was down to the special washing stuff the hotel uses on towels which turns blood to brown yeeuch. 
The bar was shut due to covoid so aquiring any tea coffee as a late arrival was out of the question, or even a bottle of water. I was 
 told Very promptly as a single person visiting and this is after 1130 at night, to go to the late night shop.  The provided kettle looked past its best with the obligatory coffee capsules also available but no cup to use apart from paper cups. Great for Covoid.
The lift doors partially opening between floors as it moved was a joy to behold so was some ominous looking guests. One of whom claimed they drove 500 miles from Kent to be in the hotel, and once spent 400 pounds on a suite at the park plaza in London per night, and that he Nearly planned to drive back this very evening 500 miles. 
The state of the hotel was blamed by the receptionist on Covid. I’m not so sure the virus should be blamed after staying there before many years previously. I was also told they are going to return when covoid goes away. Fingers crossed.",3.0,Erm late night could of done a hell of a lot better

I was unable to travel on the original booking date, as my town was flooded and we were under further potential risk and had to stay put. The hotel did NOTHING to accommodate us regarding the increase in rate, which I cannot understand how the rate would increase, when the room was DEFINITELY NOT a 4* equivalent. Room was horrendous, tatty furniture, poor lighting, 1 wasn't even working, different end tables, ripped wall paper, dam on bathroom wall, TV was strange to operate and took some work. THEN, we went to order room service and was told its only pizza or sandwich and was told to go to like the 4th page of the menu, where i tiny writing it stated 24hrs. WELL, why not just have a separate menu from 11pm on wards with exactly what is available to order. Had no choice but to go to bed hungry in the end.
Not only on my 40th birthday was i home bound due to the flooding, but to top it all off, the hotel from customer service from the central reservation team/hotel prior to arriving to the stay, state of room, 24 hour room service...we had the worst stay ever, totally ruined my celebrations. Premier Inn is better.

1747,United Kingdom,Executive Triple Room,1 night ,February 2020,Group, The room was super comfy. Absolutely stunning view. The bathroom was was amaizing with amaizing facilities. The soaps and shower gel smelt amaizing! Slept really well. The double bed was huge!, My friend had a disagreement with the staff which was not ideal at early hours of the morning. There was a massive misscommunication issue which was smooth over after I had gotten involved but it should have been the manager to diffuse that. I didn't like the fact that one of the managers said that if it was up to him we would have all been kicked out. Over a tiny disagreement that I solved in the end... The room was booked for 3 people but there was no facilities to accommodate the 3rd person I.e extra bedding for the sofa bed or extra towel. And because of the relationship we had with the staff I didn't feel comfortable asking for it - we just shared the main bed between the 3 of us which was fine.,6.0,Amaizing view of the city!

1878,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,1 night ,November 2019,Couple," My wife and I stayed here after finding ourselves stranded in Leeds and for convenience we decided to book a hotel.  The price and location were excellent.

Booking in was straight forward enough and the reception staff were pleasant enough"," The room was adequate for what we required and I would have had no complaints...….if it hadn't been for the squeaky bed!!  It was horrendous!  Getting in to bed....getting out of bed....turning in bed......the noise was ridiculous.  This was the only downside to our stay.

A letter was handed to me on arrival notifying of work on exterior of building and the receptionist also advised of this. I asked for a room away from the builders noise and was given a room on the 18th floor. The letter stated if we should require any privacy we should keep the curtains closed. Builders were working on Sunday morning drilling and banging above the floor we were on. I raised my complaint with the staff on checking out and was asked to wait for the duty manager. I advised I was unable to do this or I would have missed my train home but we agreed they would call me Monday morning. No call from them yet. I asked for a partial refund due to the state of the room and being woken up at 9am on a Sunday morning. I was told to contact booking.com as they weren't responsible for refunds.

We kindly asked if they would sort it by the time we had come back from our evening and there was a sticky note to say to use the other nozzle or the shower. There were pen marks everywhere and the windowsill was covered in flies. Definitely not a good standard of cleaning. The bedroom
 curtains were dirty and were broken and hanging off the rings, stains on the walls and there were no robes and slippers as advised in the upgrade explanation.

I pointed out that, by the time i was checking in, I'd already be parked and could they tell me how this special rate worked in advance. No one responded. I chased, and no one responded. That aside, the room I stayed in was really dated and in desperate need of a refit. This was the case for other parts of the hotel, also.

It was a good location and the room size was pretty good with large windows on  both sides, so a good aspect, however I've stayed in many places before in Leeds and this would not be my choice again."," Room wasn't very clean, I found evidence of very poor attention to detail (with the cardboard inside of a toilet roll stuffed down once side of the basin) so obviously missed by the cleaner and indicative potentially of other 'misses' in cleanliness. Also there was an unidentifiable brown stain on one of the apparently unused and 'clean' bath towels (I think it was makeup but could have been anything - dried faeces, blood). So towel not clean. Not pleasant, and my immediate request to reception for a replacement, which was received with a 'yes of course' elicited no apology and actually never arrived! Bed pillows uncomfortable. Adding insult to injury I was asked by the security guys in reception, as I returned back in the evening after a night at a concert in Roundhay Park (which was muddy and I was wearing wellington boots) to remove my boots. I had been elsewhere, the mud was dry, I'd purposefully banged my feet to remove residue outside. I was gobsmacked they held up a bin bag to put my boots in. I refused to walk through reception, into the lift and along the corridor to my room in my socks. If the Management had provided, say, slip over elasticated boot covers I would have happily complied but frankly from a health and safety point of view this management decision was very poor. Moreover it was frankly insulting and poorly executed - at £334 for 1 night I felt that a little bit of mud on their carpets was a managemeable feat for them to handle and suck up. I 'got' the purpose of the request but it was poorly managed. The hotel, in my view, and I've stayed in plenty over the world and lots in Leeds in particular was that this hotel is all 'fur and no knickers' (glitzy reception but poor standard of rooms, bedding, cleaning, staff training needs addressing in areas) and quite possibly the worst place I've stayed in in Leeds centre.",4.2,"Overpriced and below par on many levels - cleanliness, comfort, management"

The room was terribly small, as was the bed - which moved across the floor when you rolled over! The bathroom was very basic and also not cleaned very well.  There was a smell of stale damp smoke in the room which was awful. We paid extra for a superior room and feel like we were given an inferior room like they messed up our booking?

The breakfast was kept well stocked and had a good variety."," Booked for three nights for my anniversary. The room wasn't up to my expectations for being a four star hotel. It was small and extremely basic and plain. We had literally checked in, dropped bags off and raced out for remainder the day. I wasn't looking forward to going back so when we returned we requested a room change. The staff were great in accommodating us but we needed to wait til the morning. 
We got upgraded the next morning and Stan on reception couldn't have been more helpful. The executive room was far bigger but sadly again I wasn't blown away. Basic and plain. 
Also, only once we arrived did we discover that the building was half covered with scaffolding outside. Building work wasn't happening during our stay (Fri evening until Mon morning) so this didn't disrupt us, but it looked ugly and took away from staying in a high quality city centre hotel.

2028,United Kingdom,Executive Double Room,1 night ,August 2019,Solo traveler," I think it was the Executive room that I booked (322 square ft). I liked: space, wonderful value for money (when I booked), comfort, excellent breakfast, views from the top floor. Great air-conditioning, clean-smelling and cool on arrival. One of the best nights I've slept recently. Great bed. Duvet struck right balance between warmth and keeping cool, and was nice and soft. It was great being able to unwind so easily and effortlessly, even leaving the curtains open and having the lights of the city skyline gently glittering in. Well-insulated noise-wise - really, one gets a sense of getting above and away from all the hustle and bustle despite being at the heart of it all. Plush, soft carpeting in room. Nicely and classily fragranced reception. Good iron and ironing board. Shower excellent. Nice-smelling conditioner for hair. Good HD television and range of channels (Sky); the channels switch through very quickly, which isn't always the case.
I have to repeat that the breakfast is really good. Pancakes, waffles. Other items available to order. Poached egg could have been softer and more runny. The buffet breakfast is comfortably better than average. The sausages are particularly tasty. And on weekends, breakfast is open between 7 am and 11 am...quite a generous window. The decor is quite 'neon' and 'night club' if one doesn't mind, but it is a fusion restaurant during evening hours anyway."," Could have been a teensy bit cleaner. (Dusting the hidden edges) Also, maybe leaving a note by the coffee machine to prevent people withot experience from leaving a mess (definitely not me...) I think one of cleaners started some cleaning before I'd left  but I suppose I could have left a sign out.

The room was absolutely depressing and lower standard than Travelodge or other budget hotels. The staff were wonderful, but even the updated rooms were still too awful... so I refused ro stay there. I walked up the road to The Radisson and got a wonderful room for the same price! The Radisson receptionist said a man had done the ssme thing as me just the day before... had booked into the Plaza and refused to stay. Also... small thing, buy while I was in the Plaza room, a staff member brought a smallish bottle of water - at that point I was thinking of staying and asked for another because two of us were in the room... I was told they were only allowed to give us one. That's in a so-called 4* hotel.

Not all of the lights and plug sockets in my room worked. I did tell the staff this and they 1) logged faults and ensured me they'd be looked into the next day and 2) brought me a lamp so I could work in decent lighting. Nothing was done about fixing any faults whilst I was there...
Also very annoyed that I was not told on check-in that the contractors can see into my bedroom window. I do not need to go into further detail as to how horribly embarrassing getting ready one morning was.

my key, seems like they just assumed rather than checking their records and tried to act like we were scamming them (what a joke when it was the exact opposite). Security were quite rude as well when coming in from a night out assuming that because me

Once I opened the door to my room I knew it was probably going to be the first and last time I would stay here. The rooms are in need of TOTAL remonetisation and updating. Old chipped black 80’s Argos type MDF everywhere. Scuffs on every mirrored surface. Toilet dirty. Not at hook anywhere in sight in the bathroom. Don’t be fooled into thinking that being on the 20th floor will be quiet either. Could hear the pulleys of the lift all night, and BE WARNED the walls were paper thin! Luckily the couple next door were quick! But my bed head moved. Bed it self was non descriptive. Clearly location superseded anything else. So stay here if you need a great location for the town and at the moment it’s cheap. But it Leeds.
