The pictures showed a large room with a couch and coffee table, neither was in our room. We had a tiny little table not even bigger then an end table in a living room and 1 chair. When we tried to clarify that we thought our room had not been an upgrade they assured us that it was. The bathroom in the online photo’s looked big, ours was so small we both couldn’t stand in it at the same time. There is no heating in the room just airco. I wasn’t impressed with the room. We were told when we checked out that due to Covid many of the rooms had their furniture removed. Glad now we didn’t upgrade to the executive suite, but then maybe we would’ve had one extra chair next to a tiny little table.

Breakfast is good. Quite a bit of variety. Lovely hot chocolate. You can requests amongst other things, balloons and Prosecco for the room upon arrival which is nice for b day surprises etc.", As it was my partners b day I asked for an upgrade to an executive king room. This was confirmed. Shortly before we departed for Amsterdam I asked them to reconfirm as it was a surprise. Again I was told not a problem. Arrived at the hotel  and a bit of a wait even though there were 4 staff on the front desk they seemed to be slow getting guests  checked in. We went to the room we had allocated to us only to find it was the original room we booked. The lady at the front desk made it seem as though it was my fault for not confirming again at the front desk on arrival even though I had twice by email. Eventually she offered a free room upgrade but the moment had passed for the birthday surprise so we stuck with our original room which was nice enough. The pool changing rooms were closed due to COVID so it was a case of going back to you room wrapped in a towel if you didn’t what to change in front of people. Pool was nice but the filters were really dirty inside a could have done with a clean. Due to COVID we were told the the cleaning staff wouldn’t clean the room unless requested. We requested at the front desk the next morning but no one came. Finally went to concierge as we had no fresh towels soaps or hair shampoo and literally had to beg to have someone clean the room as he said we’d now missed the cut off time for requesting the room cleaned.

The hotel staff didn't call or notify us about this issue.  The only reason we selected that hotel was to have a room with view to the canal and I guess the first day we couldn't enjoy that.  Even though they moved us to a room with a view the next day, it just took away the excitement when we got there.",9.0,Very nice!

Was also quite.," With COVID the rooms can’t be cleaned which is totally fine, we don’t need our room cleaned every day HOWEVER it would be nice if they could have collected the garbage. 
With COVID the mini bar/fridge can’t not be used but when you are travelling with a toddler you need access to the fridge to store food and milk. It was such a hassle constantly telling them WHY I need the fridge to be opened three times a day. Lack of communication between staff, would have been nice if a note was put on the computer explaining our situation.

The breakfast was great, has a good selection of dishes."," The bed was one of the most uncomfortable beds I’ve slept in in a long time for a hotel of this range. It was way to low to the floor, it was way to hard, it was all around awful, if we hadn’t stayed only two nights I’ve would have left after the first one. So “slept” is a term I’m using very loosely here. To be fair all the furniture was low, the bed, the nightstand, the sofa, it was so uncomfortable. Only a chair was of normal size in the room.
There were stains on the carpet and furniture, and I didn’t see anymore because I stopped searching.",7.0,"Good hotel, bad hotel."

It wasn’t a hotel fault, just wasted. There’s 4-5 steps inside main lobby so it’ll be difficult for us who bring stroller and 2 big luggage. I am the genius level 2 from booking.com and i read the benefits is i got a free of minibar in park vic hotel but in the fact, we fully charge of minibar even the mineral water! Hotel around the wold usually give some mineral water bottle for free! But not this hotel, they put mineral water in minibar list. And they charge us for city tax too..

121,Sweden,Superior Twin Room,4 nights ,February 2020,Solo traveler," The best thing about this hotel is the location. You are right in the middle of the city center. It feels as if you are in the heart of everything. The hotel is approx 5min away from the train station. Close to all restaurants and shops. It was lovely that the hotel had a sauna and a pool. There was even a ice machine in the hotel. When you went in and out from the hotel there was a place where you could get some water for free, that was nice. Even if the hotel is in the middle of everything, I appreciated it that the hotel was somewhat sound proof. You could hear people from next door going in and out but that was it. No sound from the traffic or anything, which was nice. The staff are very customer service oriented and were attentive. Awesome that there was a minibar in the room. I loved that you could use a hand control to control everything in the room. You didn't need to get out of bed to example turn off the lights or the AC etc. Overall the best thing about this hotel is the excellent location. Close to pretty much everything."," The mattresses were a bit hard. The breakfast was underwhelming. I had expected from a big hotel like that to have a more broad selection of items in their breakfast. The door to the WC was a sliding door and it was super thin. I felt this affected the privacy in the room. There was pretty much no privacy when you went to the WC, with that kind of door. The room didn't have many hooks. Example in the bathroom you had no where to hang your clothes if you wanted to take a shower etc. The room didn't have any hooks either. Would be nice with some hooks so you could put something on it.",7.0,Excellent location!

Huge nice rooms. Refurbished with taste (bar!! breakfast room!!)," We had an issue at check-out with the staff who made us pay an extra (so-called newly due) visitor tax. Yet, I had already prepaid our stay INCLUDING (!) a visitor tax. When I had shown this to the girl at the reception desk, she told me it must be because it's a new tax. Yet, I had booked this stay already a number of days after the ""starting date"" of this new tax I had read nothing about. Hence, my stay ended in dissatisfaction, as (1) it is illegal to impose twice the  same tax and (2) no information was given prior to checking-in. It was just imposed upon checking out, leaving me with no choice as if I was a difficult guest. And (3) the girl didn't have the slightest commercial touch and cancelling the 3 euros it was about... 
This came on top of a small issue at check-in when another member of staff had said that at that time of day (22:15)  in the very heart of Amsterdam no other restaurant was open but a McDonald's around the corner... We didn't really believed that and indeed a lot of other (and better) options were still open...

We gave up the first two tries. 4) because of construction, our airport car service dropped us off a block away. It was quite a struggle to maneuver two large pieces of luggage over tram tracks, past heavy traffic and traffic barricades, and through crowds of tourists.

We arrived by train from Brussel and the hotel is in-front of the Centraal Station, you can see it clearly.

We also took the small boat cruise where the meeting point was at Anne Frank house, its <10 mins walk from the hotel. The Dam Square and red light district are all walking distance. There are 2 Malaysian restaurant nearby (Wau and Nyonya), where we feel like home. I would rate 10 for location.
The concierge personnel was very nice and polite. We opt for Van Gaugh museum & hardrock café and decided to take a taxi from the hotel despite the suggestion from him was a tram. We realized the taxi was a bit pricey (>20 Euro for one way).

The room was very modern while the architecture of the building on the outside was very historic. It was a nice juxtaposition."," I would love to give this place a solid 10 but after seeing that disgusting clump of dirt, cigarettes, bird droppings, and whatever else was in that mound located right outside of my window (the same window I paid extra for to have a nice view),  I can’t give it a 10.  I don’t know what management or housekeeping was thinking by having that nasty looking clump right  outside of the window.  But, fortunately, once they set up the third bed in the room for my daughter, I was blocked from the window, and no longer had to worry about catching glimpses of the dirty mess. When I first saw the clump, I became nauseous and was tempted to check out of the hotel altogether.

From the picture you think you’re staying in an old Victorian hotel but my room was in a modern building next door which I felt was deceiving. It was also quite a trek from the main entrance, two lifts and a walk across a small bridge linking the two properties.

347,New Zealand,Executive King Room with Iconic View (3 Adults),1 night ,July 2019,Family, The staff were helpful and efficient. Breakfast was outstanding.," When I booked I had paid extra for an expensive room - Executive King room with Iconic views for 3 adults $576 NZ as we only had the one night in Amsterdam so we thought spend the extra its going to be special.  The picture of the room on booking.com looked much bigger ( there were 3 of us and looking through the photos now not sure got the room we paid for) and showed rooms with large windows - or 3 sets of french doors even -that started lower to the ground with lots of light and amazing views. The room we got had one set of windows up higher from the floor which were not easily accessible because the sofa bed was up against that wall where the window was - when we tried to open them (while standing on the sofa bed)  they had a safety restraint and opened only so far. Fair enough we thought - safety first -  So we tried to put our phone out the gap of the window to take a photo of this Iconic View and noticed there was black safety mesh net all over he outside of the building so we couldn't properly see the Iconic view or even take a picture of it through the mesh. If you are going to charge extra or even put that in the statement line in the information don't you think you should be able to see it unemcumbered? When you look at the photos online you cant see any net on the outside of the building, the rooms look a lot bigger and do not properly represent the room we actually stayed in. I did go back down to reception and query this view situation and they offered us free breakfast which was nice but I would rather have had what I thought I was paying for. I always try to avoid confusion on check in so I had already asked  - this is what we booked is this what we are getting - the answer was Yes. But as we kiwis say - yeah but nah!",7.5,Lovely Hotel shame about the netting.

When you enter, there are 6 to 7 stairs that you have to climb to get to the reception (no lift or escalator). We had 3 bags and a toddler. Had to carry the heavy bags up even though the 3 people at the concierge were staring right at us and didn't offer to help. 
At check out, we were told that the concierge would help us eith our bags while taking our bags down but they still didnt.

The rest of the hotel staff, at least those that we have encountered, were not."," The guy at the reception area was not nice nor kind. He handled our check in quite rudely. We were lined up at the check in counter awaiting our turn, and this guy impatiently motioned for us to come near him. At first he said he could not find our reservation. Then he said that was because ""the system changed the name of the reservation"", which I find unbelievable. He appeared angry, irritated or preoccupied with something else.  He was banging his stapler on the table/counter several times, as if he was unhappy with his job. If there was something else troubling him, then he should not have handled the check in counters at that time, because it left a very disappointing experience on us as guests.
The staff at the breakfast restaurant were however really great. They were smiling and very eager to serve the guests. One lady staff even offered to take a picture of us with a beautiful background of the restaurant. That was really sweet. 
However, the same disappointment came again after check out. We left our luggages near the reception as we had extra time to spare before our train trip. However, when we came back to get our luggage, we wanted to use the restroom first. Another guy at the lobby loudly admonished us, telling us that we were not allowed to do so. We were greatly embarrassed because he did it in a loud voice for the other guests to hear, as if we were caught doing something illegal inside the hotel. 
We had to stand up for ourselves and tell the guy that we were guests of the hotel! But the experience left a very disappointing feeling in us. If we come back to amsterdam, we'd probably look for another hotel.",7.1,"great location, but bad service"

The bar staff were very friendly and the free umbrellas to use at reception were also handy as it was raining a lot!"," Our room wasn’t cleaned everyday had to ask on the 2nd day for fresh towels and toiletries etc. Breakfast wasn’t up to scratch, quoted by the receptionist “best breakfast in Amsterdam” we went on the first morning and it was busy and had to wait for fresh food but not for too long. However, on the second occasion we went and food had ran out and long wait for it to come out... also I ordered some poached eggs had to wait about 20 minutes and when they arrived I sent them straight back as they were the worst poached eggs I’ve ever seen!

The hotel was extremely well located and beautifully presented for Christmas. The Elemis toiletries were a nice surprise as was the DJ in the bar on the Saturday night!," We returned one evening to find that our room hadn't been serviced properly. Housekeeping had simply replenished the towels but had taken the room card we had left. We called reception and explained the situation and asked them to send up some of the items that were missing, ufortunately this took a few phonecalls to try to resolve and eventually we called down to reception to speak in person. They weren't concerned at all that the room key was missing and couldn't offer an explanation as to why our room had been left the way it was or indeed an apology! We asked for new keys for security reasons and only then were we offered complimentary breakfast. 
When we checked out there was a charge of €4 which couldn't be explained, the receptionist insisted it was city taxes but I explained that they were already paid and were more than €4! She then insisted we must have had something charged to the room which we hadn't so we asked her to find out what the charge was and her reply was ""it's only €4""  at this point we just paid it and left as we had a train to catch and it was very obvious that she really couldn't care less!

Polite and nice personnel."," Well, our story starts bad for us from the beginning: arrived after a 20 hours flight at 07:00 we had to wait until 14:00 hours for getting the room, no early check-in available (yet receptionist was very kind to say they put our room on the queue- so well I believed after 7 hours waiting.) Next morning we get knocked on the door by hotel personnel at 9:30 for what we believed to be house keeping, leaved the room in 5 minutes but when we got back at 15:30, surprise no room making; it was done after 16:00. Next days we came back not before 16:00. The""make my room"" sign was always on, when leaving the room. After 3-th night here it came the cherry on the cake: our room was only: bed arranged and towels changed no vacuum cleaning or bath mop the floor or any wash, no fresh linen?! Every time the coffee or shower gel was not replaced ( yet they put more than enough sugar, creamer or body cream)-I got my coffee by request daily. Our TV did not work. Second night I asked the technician to fix it, but after a short check he went out saying it is a system setting to be made, no result; next evening I get down to reception-no reaction, third time i go day time to reception and in 10 minutes I have the visit of an another technician that fix the problem-a faulty cable; nice for a 4 star hotel in the heart of Amsterdam.

I told them in advanced that I am going to arrive at 02:00 AM.
They reassured me and confirmed that the room will be ready for us as described without any troubles.
Even though I did all of this, when I arrived I've been told that the room was given already to someone else because I arrived so late (even though I emailed in advanced that I was gonna arrive late)
and I was given a double-bed room instead.
The room is a bit tiny, but I didn't mind that as it facilitated everything I needed except the AC:
* The Air Conditioner is too weak, it couldn't compete with the hot weather in Amsterdam. It took many many hours of the AC working before the room cooled down so I could fall asleep and until the room was cool enough I couldn't fall asleep from the heat.
Actually I wanted to pay extra for a hotel with a good AC to combat the heat, but I felt like I paid the extra (compared to other results) without getting the extra AC benefit I was hoping for, for most of the night.

The complete Hotel has a heavy Aftershave smell all over the place. 
Someone on the floor decided to listen all night long to dance music, so it feels like staying in a bachelor hostel not a 140EUR/Night 4 Stars Hotel.
You are not able to leave the shower without creating a wet mess on the floor in front of the toilet, because opening the shower door pushes the water on the floor.  Great Design!",5.0,Ok for a Night but would prefer other locations in Amsterdam.

Due to a late train, we didn't arrive until 3 pm, giving the hotel an extra hour to prepare our room. But it still wasn't ready when we arrived. Furthermore, the staff was unable to tell us how much more time was needed before the room would be ready.  It was a cold and wet day; we had been looking forward to a hot shower. Instead, as we had no idea how long the wait would be, we went right back outside to wander around for another hour. By itself, this isn't so bad, but the same thing happened to us in a different Park Plaza Victoria hotel (London) not too long ago. The pattern doesn't build confidence. Furthermore, our particular room must have been near a metal overhang just outside, because the drip-drip-drip from the rain made quite a racket during the night.

During check out when asked our stay we again relayed the incident to which we got a ‘well we could change your room’. Seeing as we were checking out this was no consolation.

The TV had lots of digital interference... not that you're there to watch tele, shower was okay, but not the best I've had in (lesser) hotels.

I was asked to show the confirmation as they only have 2 rooms in the whole hotel that match that criteria, I was even told that I needed to contact the property before hand to request the balcony and the bathtub even though I had written confirmation about the room features.
So I showed how in my confirmation it was clearly stated that the Executive King Room had those features, I was told “No, those are just the hotel features” which I replied these are clearly the room features as is under the Room features tab to what the staff member agreed.
When I did the check in the receptionist assured me my room had the balcony and the bathtub as I asked before signing the check in form, so when I go up and I see no balcony I was angry...
Had to come down again and had to ask to speak to the manager, then I was told the balcony does not open anyways due to safety reasons so its the same as having a window....what kind of answer that?!
I was told I was lucky as they have found a room with a bathtub and a view and that was an “upgrade” because this room had a view even though it did not have the advertised balcony. (Room 137)
Obviously by now I’m getting more and more angry , thinking why did I choose to book in this hotel where I’m being charged +600 euros for a 3 day stay and not even getting what is advertised.
After a lot of pushing the manager came and I was finally shown and offered the twin room (2 small beds) with balcony & bathtub which was significantly smaller and did not take it.

check in was handled with staff that should not be placed there cause she was not fit, had a cold and keep touching her nose. where's the hygiene?
raining, no umbrella in the room for you. asked in the concierge, the answer is to check nearby their desk, if none means no more. 
minibar is super annoying! it's an automatic fridge system. but i paid for the room, i expect i can put things into the fridge, but the second you move things, it will charge your room bill straightaway! had to cool my things near the window instead!

(2) Additional services were charged at an extortionate rate
     - laundry service
     - room service food was ordered on one occasion and never again, as the expensive steak meal ordered came with absolutely no accompaniment (vegetables or chips).

1104,United Kingdom,Superior King Room,3 nights ,October 2019,Couple, The only good thing about the hotel is one member of the staff (Jordi) wo was really helpful and tried to solve a lot of issues we were having.," Even so we booked a kings size bed - it wasn't prepared (there were 2 separate beds) and we had to wait for at least an hour for someone to come and fix it into one. There was also a loud and constant dropping sound in the room from above that couldn't be fixed. One of the staff members (Jordi) was very nice and tried his best to fix it for us but it wasn't possible -he booked for us another room for the next day, so we had to live with that for the rest of the night. Then at around midnight someone started to smoke in a room near us and the smell in our room got pretty strong. We called the reception and another guy told us that he would send someone. We were waiting for half an hour but no-one came. We called again and the same guy obviously didn't remember neither the issue nor our room and said that everyone was busy therefore he couldn't help but will try his best. No-one came for another 20 mins. We decided to switch on the air- conditioner and go to sleep. A huge bulk of dust dropped out of air conditioner. Btw a handle of the bathroom door also dropped - it wasn't fixed... We didn't stay in the hotel for the rest 2 nights that were booked. We spoke in the morning with the manager but she didn't apologize. She did refund us the last 2 nights but the first night was paid at full with the highest price and no compensation offered despite we couldn't really sleep because of the loud dropping sound, waiting for half a night for them to meet their promise of non- smoking room but without any success. And breakfast wasn't really so great especially comparing to another hotel we moved to... Facilities also don't deserve 4 stars... So definitely not a 4- star hotel and service...

1136,United States of America,Superior King Room,1 night ,September 2019,Couple," My wife and I were disappointed with our hotel stay.  On the positive side, breakfast was excellent, as well as the hotel location.  And the bed certainly was comfortable.  And while the hotel was too “high-tech” for us older people, nonetheless, I do understand the hotel’s desire to offer modern technology to its client base."," Having said that, some comments:
1.	 Regarding high tech, the person bringing our luggage to our room could have spent more time explaining how the TV works.  We had great difficulty understanding all the prompts and controls on the TV remote.  And of course, the TV remote indicated a low battery level.  Maybe that created some of our difficulty whenever we pressed a button expecting it to work.  Hence, never really watched TV.
2.	While I realize European hotel rooms tend to be somewhat smaller than American hotels, I find it very inconvenient not to have any chest drawers available to unpack our suitcase.
3.	Ran out of Kleenex (nose wipers) in the bathroom almost immediately after we checked in.
4.	Your hotel clerk (male) checking us in was most rude and unfriendly, as if we were disturbing his day.  Admittedly, we got to the hotel early, with the Holland America cruise ship’s early disembarkation, and your hotel clerk (female)  could not have been more friendly and courteous in helping us store our baggage and advising when it might be advisable to recheck for early check-in prior to 1400 hours.  But when we arrived shortly before 1300 hours, your male hotel clerk insisted that no rooms were available and that we could not check in before 1400 hours.  Only after we advised him that the other hotel clerk (female) advised us that most likely they would have rooms available after around 1200 hours did this hotel clerk (male) reluctantly find us a room that was available (Room 103).  
5.	That evening, we had a drink in your hotel bar.  It took between 15 and 20 minutes to get our glasses of wine after we ordered them --- Unacceptable!  While I do realize us Americans tend to be somewhat impatient, nonetheless, that was unacceptable service. 
All in all, considering the cost of the room vs. value received, we cannot rate your hotel highly!",6.7,Poor value for the money!

The gentleman who helped me Saturday night got so distracted 4 to 5 times in a 5 to 10 minute time frame when I was trying to talking to him.. He must have been a man who wore many hats. I’m pretty sure he wasn’t a manager, but if he is then he needs a raise.

1172,Australia,Superior King Room,4 nights ,August 2019,Solo traveler," The location was excellent. Very convenient to Central Station and hence, easy to travel to and from Schiphol airport. It was also easy to get to places, such as catching the tram to the Rijksmuseum. I could walk to lots of interesting place. My family were able to meet me conveniently. The first reception staff member was engaging, friendly and helpful."," I had wanted a room with a view but I was given a room at the very back corner of the hotel (265). The cleaner at Macdonalds in the alley behind the hotel made lots of noise at 3-4am every morning, waking me up. Considering jet lag, I could not get back to sleep for hours. The bathroom: there was orange mould in the grout of the tiles. This was extensive. The back of the glass door in the bathroom was dirty from top to bottom and not cleaned in a long time. It was covered in water marks and stains. The state of the bathroom was poor. I had trouble getting through to reception on the phone. The TV was not working. When I was able to get through to the Concierge, they said they would contact reception. After 90 minutes I managed to get through to reception who said they had not received the message. They sent someone up immediately who did reboot the TV.  I ordered room service. I wanted a desert with my dinner. They didn't serve desert in the rooms even though it said on the TV details about the hotel, that they did. However, after I raised my concern, Room Service rang me back to tell me they could arrange a desert for my meal. When the food was delivered I was told to leave the tray outside my room. I asked if I needed to ring Room Service to tell them it was ready to pick up. She said no. The tray was still there the next morning. I rang Room Service who said they would send someone to pick it up immediately. This did not happen. When I went to breakfast I told reception and the concierge. They said they would resolve it. It was still there when I went out at 11am.  Finally, on several occasions I had to wait for help at the Concierge desk while he was having conversations and chatting with other staff away from the desk. He continued to chat even when he saw me standing at the desk. When he did help me, there was no apology. As soon as he finished helping me, the man (an older man with glasses), went straight back to his conversation away from the desk.",5.4,I had high expectations and was disappointed in the overall standard of the hotel service.

1569,China,Superior Twin Room,4 nights ,August 2018,Couple," This hotel is the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed at. It was the most terrible experience I’ve ever had. Our rate was over 320 euros per night. When we arrived, a male and female receptionist gave us a very tiny room despite that this hotel was in a low season with lots of empty rooms. We tried to confirm with them that if all the rooms are same sized, and they lied by saying ‘yes’. How terrible and horrible are they, trying to rip customers off. We required them to change us to a room which values the outrageous 320 euro for three times. Each time they gave us a little bigger one. If we did not insist and they would never tell the truth. Where is your integrity and honesty, this is the way you treat your guests? This is not end of story. The hotel’s alarm was triggered by a ‘God-knows’ reason. Every guest was robbed from their sleep 4 clock in the morning. Firemen appeared but found nothing like a fire warning. After over 40 minutes of this ridiculous disturbance, their pathetic explanation was ‘something wrong with the system, not our fault’. Come on, it is your hotel, this faceless explanation is so absurd. Of course it is your fault. And also, the hotel’s staff wear so fake smiles and treat guests impatiently. I can’t image a chain Park Plaza hotel in the center of Amsterdam could be such a hideous place!!!!"," This hotel is the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed at.

1590,France,Executive King Room,2 nights ,July 2018,Couple, The restaurant and the bar were quite nice and the staff there were very helpful.," In a junior suite there were only two plugs for recharging phones etc. No USB sockets. When removing the room key card from the master switch when leaving the room, the plugs are turned off as well as the lights, so impossible to recharge an iPad while having breakfast, for example.
There was no attempt by the hotel to soundproof the rooms by the door, so laying in bed, it was easy to hear conversations in the corridor and therefore anyone passing the room could hear the conversation within the room. There are major road works outside the hotel so after taking a taxi from the airport it was still necessary to drag our cases about 150 yards. We were not given any forwarning of this. On entry to the hotel you still have to carry your cases up about 5 steps.

At 9.30 we headed to relax in the pool area, but were aggressively interupted by the same group of guests. A congierge came to get them out, yet they were still hanging around the hotel which made us feel unsafe. At 4 am that night people were running down the corridor, and playing loud music till 6 am. We complained but nothing was done and there was no further compensation. This behaviour by guests should be punished instead of brushed off. The location was great and the staff very kind.

Thirdly room service didn’t bring all the products we paid for. For paying just under £1000 for 4 nights you do expect amazing service at least but felt like there was lack of.,6.2,Pleasant
1787,Thailand,,2 nights ,August 2018,Group, Nothing," We stayed at hotel 2 nights and had very bad impression, especially from the front desk staffs including the manager to the housekeepers.
On the day we checked in at August 11, we asked the rooms to be on the same floor since we booked 2 rooms. They gave us different floor on different building without saying sorry and just hand us the keycards. When we found out about this and walked back, the manager just said he could do nothing, and again without saying sorry to us.
When at room, we called the housekeeper to ask for the slipper, he said very rude to us and make us very angry. And he didn't bring the slipper we asked for.
When my friend from the another room called to ask for other services, the hotel staff hanged up phone immediately without asking anything or calling back.
Even the room is o.k., all of staffs, especially the front desk, the manger, and the housekeepers should be changed. The service is terrible and the ways they speak to the customers are unacceptable.
We stayed at more than hundreds hotel all around the world, and this hotel service is by far one of the worst. The hotel should be rated only 1 - 2 stars. We will never get back to this hotel again.",4.6,Terrible Services!
