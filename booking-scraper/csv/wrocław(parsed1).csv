She asked for my passport or ID card. I’m Canadian but I’m a permanent resident of Germany. Canadians are not allowed to travel to Poland at the moment so I was trying to give her my EU ID. She had no patience at all (my Eu I’d was in my wallet In my backpack)and was telling me to just give her my passport this was enough, if I had known that I would have done so right away. However as we stayed here on our way to Slovakia a week prior and was required to show my residence permit this is why I was getting it ready for her. She took my documentation and gave us our room keys. We went to the room, everything was pleasant and nice. However when we left I informed the lady at checkout we had three items from the mini bar, one cola, one vodka and one jack Daniels. I paid and just as I was about to leave her phone rang and she told me “my colleague said you had two vodkas”. I said ok maybe my husband had one and I paid for it and left. Once my husband and I left the hotel I asked him, he said he did not have any vodka at all. I went back to explain this and the lady who was there checking me out was no longer there. I tried to talk to who was at the reception but she didn’t understand me. So we left. It was probably a mistake with the Pepe who rented the room before us, or a housekeeping mistake regarding the vodka. We know we didn’t have it, we paid for it anyways.
