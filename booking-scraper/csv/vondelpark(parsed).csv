Liked the decor style and the bed was super comfortable. Also liked having Nespresso machine in room. Great bathroom too. Loved the linens on the bed - natural fibers, good quality."," We arrive 30 minutes before breakfast was to close and the buffet supplies were very very low. It felt like they were already trying to close up. We paid full price for the breakfast so we should have gotten a full experience. They also turned off coffee machines right at 11 (closing time) even though we were still eating our breakfast. The decor at times felt a little low quality and I wonder how it will age.

50,United Kingdom,Superior Queen Room,4 nights ,March 2020,Solo traveler, Excellent location in quiet plush upmarket neighbourhood a few minutes walk from Vondel Park. There are many bars and brasseries within a short walking distance. A 15 minute tram ride will take you into the centre of town. The excellent Kashmir Lounge coffee shop and very welcoming local bars are a 20 minute walk away on Jan Pieter Heijestraat. The hotel (397 bus from the airport to Emmastraat) is superb and beautifully appointed. The Italian themed bar and restaurant were constantly busy during my stay. The staff were extremely helpful and attentive and went out of their way to make you feel welcome. I was upgraded to a larger room at no extra cost.," Breakfast was a little disorganized at times. I had to request my food to be re-heated because it was cold from the buffet. Some of the food took a while to be replaced with fresh items. Overall, the breakfast was a little underwhelming.",9.0,"Excellent, spotlessly clean and well appointed hotel with very helpful and welcoming staff."

Location was good next to Vondelpark, and near museums."," I reserved a room with garden view, and got email confirmation from Park Plaza.  When I got there they tried to give me a street view.  Finally upgraded to a room that was too high and more viewed a building than the garden.
Lights are controlled at a multi-switch next to bed, instead of individual lights for different locations in the room.  This is inconvenient, doesn't enable doing the lighting we wanted, and hard to learn to use.  They should go back to the old system and ditch this new tech one.
breakfast was ok, but hard to get anything smaller than the more costly buffet.",9.0,Wonderful

Gorgeous bathrooms - luxury. Beds were extremely comfy - best nights sleep ever!"," We can’t fault the hotel itself, however we dined at TOZI on our first night and this restaurant seriously let’s down the branding and messaging of the hotel.
When we arrived we asked for a reservation at the restaurant for 6pm. The receptionist kindly took us to the restaurant reservations team where we were told it was totally fully booked. Even for 6pm they had zero tables available. Disappointed we headed back to our room, changed and went back down to try TOZI bar. We asked if it was possible to order something from the restaurant to eat in the bar. The very rude bar lady told us absolutely not - and instead offered us a table reluctantly in the restaurant. Upon arrival in the restaurant we looked around to find only 2 tables occupied. It was now 6.30pm. The atmosphere in the restaurant was hostile and pretentious, men in tweed suits prancing around doing nothing and dictating what and how we should order from the menu - there was sexism in the patronising way they spoke to us. The food was ok, although they need to work on their carbonara as it was actually pasta in a cheese fondu sauce which after a couple of mouthfuls was inedible. The lardons were also covered in pig hair. The wine was free poured instead of being bought to us by the glass. After a very disappointing dining experience we walked past the reservation screen and noted that half the table had not been reserved so why were we told it was fully booked? We would strongly urge hotel management to rethink its association with this restaurant.",9.0,"Beautiful and luxurious hotel, let down badly by its association with TOZI restaurant"

The hotel is modern, quiet, clean and located across from beautiful Vondel Park, which is a good location if you want to be a little outside the hustle of the touristy city center, but close enough to it.  It is close to museums, which are within a short walk (about 8-10 minutes).  Our family prefers to walk so walking distance is subjective.  The street train is super easy to catch and use. You can buy train tickets on the train (no cash, card only). Plenty of restaurants and a few shops nearby.  Beverages in the minibar were free but didn't have much in it (water, apple juice, and sparkling water).  The air conditioning and blackout curtains on remote control were lovely!

189,Turkey,Superior Queen Room,2 nights ,January 2020,Couple," The staff at the reception was extremely welcoming when we arrived.
I requested a room that was not close to the elevator, and that's what we got. The check-in process was very smooth.
I did like the design of the room. It was nice to have coffee in the morning when we woke up."," We had a bit of an unpleasant situation. In the morning of our check out day, my partner and I were headed to the gym, when I realized, my AirPods were missing. After looking everywhere, I figured they were taken. My partner and I were traveling from Brussels, where I was for work. I retraced my steps. I clearly, had my AirPods with me when we left Brussels. And I remembered unpacking in Amsterdam, and seeing my pods in the pouch where I keep all of my cables (as any frequent traveler would I suppose). Before going downstairs, I asked my friend, who is the Guest Relations Manager at a five-star hotel, what is the general procedure. I then went down to speak with the reception. The person I spoke to was skeptical. Surely, that's her job to make sure, I was not making this up. When someone you never met, is doubting you, and your judgment, it is really hard to explain, that you are a responsible person, frequent traveler, and someone whose work is recognized internationally and that you would not make something like this up. She did inform the manager, who spoke to me shortly after. As we were checking out, the manager once again, approached me and said there will be a thorough investigation and that they would get back to me. I thanked the manager for the effort. And apologized for bringing this up, but I also had no other choice but to report the incident. Later in the evening, we noticed that my partner was also missing some cash. The reason we only noticed it then, was because it was our local currency. And since we were headed back home, we wanted to make sure we had enough cash for a taxi from the airport. Just as it was in my case, that pouch never left the room and he too was absolutely certain he arrived at the hotel with all the money in the pouch. I realize, this is why hotels have a safe but honestly, I thought it was a hotel with a reputational name to it! I also did not want to leave negative scores because we enjoyed the rooms and the service.",7.0,"Beautiful location in a quiet neighborhood, walking distance to main museums & comfortable rooms"
190,Norway,Superior Queen Room,2 nights ,January 2020,Family, The design of the hotel is really nice. The rooms are provided with everything you need.

The breakfast is poor.",6.0,"Great location and atmosphere, but poor breakfast and surprises with extra payments."
191,Italy,Superior Queen Room,4 nights ,January 2020,Couple, Excellent location for the distance from the center (also wit tram). Nice breakfast content despite the relatively small space.

197,Netherlands,Superior Queen Room,1 night ,August 2019,Couple, Only had to stay one night.," Our room was dirty. Had a dried up mucus-like substance on our bed sheet, blood stain on the covers, the tables were extremely dusty and the shower drain had hairs from the previous guests. I notified the reception. They took half an hour to clean the room and only managed to remove the hair from the shower. We were given cookies to compensate for the trouble. Laughable to say the least. 
Besides the condition of the room, the check in process was cumbersome. I signed less documents getting a mortgage. Also, why reserve 50 euros on the guests' CC if you only offer water in the mini bar?",3.3,Great location betrayed by the lacklustre service and poor hygiene.
198,Saudi Arabia,Superior Queen Room,8 nights ,August 2019,Family, The staff in general were very kind and helpful and polite. I loved them all! The hotel is well maintained. The rooms are small.

204,United Kingdom,,3 nights ,November 2020,Solo traveler," Charming hotel with nice staff in a chic, green corner of Amsterdam right by the Vondel Park"," The restaurant menu was very limited and the portion size and price of the food was disappointing. I spent almost 45 euro on three small ""sharing"" plates of food and a cup of coffee. Really bad value for money! One plate of food was cold (aubergine parmeggiana) and the other at best luke warm.  The waiter was sweet and offered to replace it and gave me a free pudding .. in ""normal times"" this would not be a problem as there are plenty of places to eat near by but current covid 19 restrictions means they are all closed and I had to eat at the hotel or get a take-away. My suggestion to the hotel would be to improve the pricing and the range of food available especially while you have a ""captive""
audience.

The rooms are recently refurbished and the hotel has a clean, modern feel."," The standard rooms feel quite small, especially if you are not travelling alone.  The shower portion of the bathroom is is translucent, meaning that your vague silhouette can sometimes be seen from the bedroom.
Bike hire is available, but at a cost of 50 Euro per day (first day) and 10 Euro per day (second day and thereafter).  Alternative bike hire is available from 3 different vendors near the Vondelpark at a lower initial cost.
