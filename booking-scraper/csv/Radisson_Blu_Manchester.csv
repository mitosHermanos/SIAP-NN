146,United Kingdom,Premium Room,1 night ,September 2020,Couple," The Radisson Blu, Manchester Airport is located directly between terminals one and two, with an additional 3 minutes walk to terminal 3. The Radisson boasts large rooms, with extremely comfortable beds, perfect for a good night sleep-pre flight! Some of the rooms offer an impressive run-way view, which is ideal to get you into the holiday mood. Having stayed in both run-way view rooms and city view rooms, I did not hear any noise disturbances from the airfield. My partner and I always opt for the Radisson Blu, and usually book dinner at a nearby pub when travelling so I am unable to comment on restaurant services. However there is a very elegant looking restaurant/bar on site should you wish to dine. The biggest selling point however is the closeness to the terminals. Terminal 2 being a mere couple of minutes walk away, Terminals 1 and 3 being 5-7 minutes walk at most. The Radisson Blu is the perfect hotel for a pre-flight stay. Reception staff have always been extremely friendly and informative.

Very poorly signposted from the terminals to find it; even airport staff weren't sure which way to direct us.
Some of the evening meal was very poor and over-priced.
The TV has an HDMI socket on the wall to connect to that doesn't work and even the HDMI sockets in the TV istelf are disconnected - unless you have Google Cast you can't access the TV for other devices. That was a major blow as my partner is hard of hearing and streaming through a large screen with subtitles helps her immensely. Despite the high price tag that wasn't possible here.

She was charming and made really helpful suggestions. Nothing was too much trouble for her. She is a great asset and made our stay," To be honest the rest of the staff were unfriendly, unsmiling and couldn't care less, particularly the bar and Restaurant Managers. We had ordered cocktails and as they take a while to make we had ordered another. As I put my empty glass down the bar Manager arrived and asked if we were ordering another. He didn't seem to believe me when I told him we had, luckily the waiter arrived with our drinks. There was no greeting or smile just a sales push I didn't appreciate. By the way when you are paying £9 for a cocktail the glass should be full.
  This is the second time we have eaten in the Restaurant. Breakfast is nice but this is the second time the food at dinner has been dreadful. The pate was horrible dense, bitter, with soggy toast, no chutney. We were not asked how we would like our main meals cooked which were completely over cooked when they arrived.  My burger was so dry and over cooked I couldn't eat it. I asked the unfriendly waiter for another as I couldn't swallow it without taking a drink.  The Manager who was unsmiling and unfriendly asked what was wrong and I explained it was burnt and over cooked and asked for another, medium. The second burger was worse it was even more over done, when you cut it in half and squeezed there was no moisture. The Manager apologized and asked if I wanted another. I declined as any even I can cook burgers better than that. We had hoped the food had improved since our last visit but it hasn't.",8.3,Disapointing

2530,United States of America,Superior Room with Runway View,2 nights ,March 2019,Solo traveler," When I booked this hotel for easy access to the London Heathrow Airport, I paid the extra money to have Breakfast and Dinner included. Don't bother! The breakfast was nothing to get excited about. Also, it was not explained beforehand that dinner would only be offered from a VERY limited menu (called the Bed and Breakfast option when I checked in). Only 4 options to pick from for main entree. It did offer Starter, Entree and desert. The started I chose was the Caesar salad, a real joke of 7-10 lettuce leaves with dressing. Since I stayed 2 nights, my choices were very limited. Don't expect to order from the regular menu! Ordered the bacon cheeseburger the first night. Hamburgers in the restaurant came in 3 sizes. My option was only the smallest on the menu. I DID pay for these meals, but I felt like the hotel/restaurant thought they were giving me my meals for free. Second night, had the Fish and Chips. Have you ever had lukewarm fried food? Well, that's what it was. The regular items being served at tables all around me looked very hot, tasty and worthy of a Radisson Restaurant. Just don't expect it if you get the breakfast and dinner package."," See what I wrote above. Bar was INCREDIBLY overpriced and the main ""Manager"" was very rude. The bartenders were nice (Quasam?). He went the extra mile to find the bottle of wine I wanted but overcharged me. I pointed that out to him, and he apologized and made amends and corrected his mistake. The Main Manager actually made a derogatory comment to me about being American and a comment under his breath as to how ""they"" (I assume Americans) are not understandable referring to my accent. I ordered a Tanquerey, rocks, with olives. The young lady behind the bar said ""We don't have olives behind the bar"". I asked if they had cocktail onions. ""No, we don't have those ether.""  I asked in a nice way, how could you not have olives behind a bar? How do you make martinis. This was overheard by the Manager, who stomped over to a cooler, pulled out a jar of olives, and nastily said, ""Of course, we have olives"", like I was some kind of idiot. I told him that it was not me that claimed there were no olives, but the bartender. Then he got a shaker out and started to make a martini, still being very nasty in his demeanor. He also got out the vermouth. I said, ""No, I don't want any vermouth"". To which he answered, ""I know the recipe for a martini!"" I responded, well, I didn't order a martini, I ordered gin on the rocks with olives. Then he got really snotty. That's when he made the comment about Americans. This ended up costing me $15. Go figure.",7.9,Convenient.

The flight was on time so we had booked a month or so earlier. My wife stays here when she goes to relatives in south west Ireland as well. This time we had had the full Manchester. Airport treatment, walked for miles in totally unnecessary queue lanes -  when we hit them with an EasyJet load there was nobody at the passport machines, but they didn’t let us in about half way down, maybe they enjoy watching people dragging or carrying their luggage up and down a dozen or two times, meeting people for the first time as they pass time and time again, eventually by the time they hit the passport machines.feeling like old friends. To tell the truth, on the way out we could have done with a night at the Radisson following the trauma of Manchester Airport’s uniquely uncivilised ‘security’ treatment. Maybe if they persuaded whoever trains the Radisson staff to retrain the security staff at the Airport itself that might help passengers to be treated like human beings instead of ignorant cattle. Our room key didn’t work, so a staff member shot up to the room with new keys and a smile and an apology. At breakfast the staff were welcoming, making it feel that everybody was glad to see us, and of course, whoever was behind the scenes preparing the breakfasts had a touch of genius."," At the Radisson Hotel?

3550,United Kingdom,Standard Room,1 night ,October 2018,Couple, Room very comfortable very clean through out hotel.," Dinner at the Hotel nice surroundings not to busy. We had got a package with breakfast and dinner. The dinner we had on the whole was not good. It was from the set menu. First course  chicken wings with dip very good and served nice and hot. I said if the next courses  be s nice meal But sadly  that was not the case I chose  the burger. Well presented but it wss over done and very dry  it was like eating cardboard. The bun was done to s crisp and not easy to get a knife through As for the rasher of bacon that was hard extremely  over cooked,It could of been done at Breakfast  and wss left over The chips was nice but as for the burger I could of got a better burger in Burger  King. I told the waiter and showed s bit of burger to him and showed how it broke up in prices as I touched  it. All he could say or our burgers are well done. I said  that's fine but they should have moisture  within them this is like eating  cardboard
The desert  I asked if was a backed cheesecake  he replied  it's not hot.
We both had that it arrived nice presentation  with raspberries  and a sauce  drizzled  over no ice cream or cream.It wss differently not baked.it was a biscuit  base√ filled with a mouse  type filling but it was not light it was firm, rubbery with far to much geletine. When eating it was cladding  inside your mouth.
I saw the matra De  (Supervisor )later she seemed to take it all in !! And went in some way of putting it right with a couple of glasses wine.
Also found out that they did not deliver your newspaper to your door outside but you had to get it from reception and the weighing scales  it's a 1.00pound. It's less money 20p for putting air in your tyres 
These  things I would not have expected  paying over 200 pounds and a 4 star hotel.
But from that it's very convenient  for terminal  2.

Waiting for the price to drop so we can afford it.  My only other old chestnut of a gripe is I miss the little snack buscuits, no matter the cost of the room - you don't get any!  Appreciate corporate cost cuttings are essential to maintain competitive room prices, but I've paid 60 percent less at Ibis and McDonalds and enjoyed an excellent drinks tray including biscuits.  
Bit of an inconvenience when the toilet failed to flush, no pun intended.  Reported it on checking out, hopefully it was sorted for the next occupants.   Only dicovered the problem in the early hours of the morning, therefore could not report it sooner.

The room was well furnished, quiet  and had nice views.The toiletries were well chosen and the bathroom bright and welcoming. The TV was easy to negotiate. When the air conditioning failed to work the person on  the'one-stop service' phone quickly sent a skilled electrician/handyman to sort it out, and when, unfortunately, his attempts were unsuccessful I was given another equally good room nearby.
In addition, I had supper in the restaurant and asked if I could have a 'main- size 'Caesar Salad, instead of the Starter size.

4040,United Kingdom,Superior Room with Runway View,1 night ,August 2018,Solo traveler," The breakfast was one of the best I've ever had in a hotel. Really good sausages and hash-browns.  A good choice of savoury and sweet without being overwhelming. A minus point is the distance between the buffet and the table making ""going back for seconds"" a bit of trail. 
Yes, the croissants were amazingly crispy - would have had a second one - but so far to go............................better for the figure, I suppose.
Staff on reception and in the breakfast room were welcoming, polite and very helpful.  Reception especially can be a bit brusque in some hotels - not here!"," The information booklet in the room has ""everything"" in it - but not everything easy to find.  Time and location of breakfast was not in the ""dining"" section as I would have expected.  The information was there, but in a ""general"" section.
At breakfast, staff may well have helped if I'd asked, but I had to make several trips between the buffet and table to take juice, cereal, fruit, bread/croissant, jam and plate of hot breakfast. A tray would have been a big help.  If there were some there, I didn't see them.
Big disappointment were the home-baked rolls - white and dark.  Rock-hard and dry.  Been sitting exposed to the dry air too long.  Completely dehydrated.
As I said above, croissant didn't suffer the same fate.  All that butter, I suppose!
Coffee a bit disappointing.  Don't drink it often, so maybe it's how proper coffee drinkers like it.
Oh and a couple of packets of biscuits/crackers in the room would have been nice.",9.6,"At the beginning or end of a long journey, a comfortable, welcoming and convenient place to stay."

Our views from the room were fantastic of the run way.  Meals at the little M bar and then the Collage restaurant were excellent and breakfast was everything from pastries to full English.

4129,United Kingdom,Standard Room,1 night ,August 2018,Couple, Location and excellent if expensive breakfast.," We have stayed here several times and although the location is excellent I still feel the prices are extortionate and there should be more special prices for regular guests. I'm amazed there are no USB charging points in the rooms for such a big hotel, I've been in lots of hotels in the past couple of years and this is the only one I have ever known to not provide these. Also on Booking in we were told breakfast was served until 11am but when arriving at the dining room at 10am  we were told it actually ended at 10 30 so the buffet was  a little rushed. It seemed we weren't the only guests told this as some more people came to eat at 10 30 who had also been given this information. The waitress did keep the buffet open for longer and was very apologetic.",9.6,Exceptional

They said they had contacted the hotel who were unable to refund the charge on the phantom ""extra"" room that was never needed. Guess what? when we arrived the lovely receptionist cancelled the extra room and refunded without a problem. The Booking.com reply caused anxiety whilst we were out of the country.

We arrived late and were offered an upgrade to the business floor which was lovely but I don’t think they expected to have to upgrade us as the mini bar was locked and there was no milk to make tea or coffee. We were not told about breakfast but were offered 2 morning alarm calls.. all in all though the hotel is lovely and the beds comfortable.

4199,Canada,Superior Room with Runway View,1 night ,August 2018,Solo traveler," Liked the location: it’s so easy to walk to the station and all airport terminals; luggage trolleys were available outside the hotel doors (cost £1); 
My (superior) room was extremely clean and well maintained; I slept well and did not hear any hotel noise, I had a view of the airport. 
Staff were pleasant."," I wish that....parking was less confusing: I couldn’t figure out the pay-and-display machine, even with help from two officials on site. I eventually gave up and asked at reception & was told not to use those machines, “they’re too expensive”. Why not remove them then??!! Paid £9 for 2 hrs parking. 
I wish there was an informal place to get a herbal tea and sandwich. The greeter at the restaurant told me to try the  hotel bar which seemed to serve only pizza with fries and a tiny salad — same menu for room service. I’m not a fan of pizza so ended up with hot water w/ lemon and a packet of crisps :( not at all what I wanted. 
 
Staff were pleasant and competent but not particularly knowledgeable, nor did they go out of their way to help. I asked two staff for help with directions and parking. They sent me off to another floor and then continued their conversation. I came by about 1/2 hour later and they were still standing around chatting. 
Would have liked an express checkout statement prior to
Departure - usually, hotels put this statement under your door prior to checkout. Actually, I didn’t get any documentation at all on departure, just hope I was charged the correct amount. 
I would stay again due to the convenience and cleanliness of the hotel. I will make other arrangements for meals.",8.8,"Good location, very clean; lacking ‘heart’"

There was no room service menu in the booklet so I had to walk and ask for one. I actually wanted to order a glass of wine but got a pizza menu.
My reflection was that it’s not the standard I am used to when I travel business class for work.

All we were offered was a complimentary pint of beer.

Good location, a bit of a trek with heavy bags from T1, but at least it was all undercover to save us from the rain."," Breakfast was very disappointing. The waitress who greeted us was friendly and helpful, took our order for coffee and when she brought the coffee took our orders for hot food. 
There was a buffet available with individual portions of cereals, fruits, muffins, ham, etc., but we decided to select the hot option. I chose the full English breakfast and toast, while my girlfriend chose the breakfast panini. After about 10 minutes the waitress returned to apologise and say that they had no paninis left and so took an order of sausage and scrambled egg as a substitute. 5 minutes later she returned with a panini and said the chef had managed to find one. She then reconfirmed my order 15 minutes after taking it and I had to wait another 5-10 minutes before it was served. The overall impression was of a kitchen that was badly disorganised.
Both options were not particularly good quality. The panini wasn’t toasted very well and didn’t appear to have any egg mayonnaise. The full English was all there, but none of it tasted particularly good. The coffee was also not particularly good. 
As we had arrived late the previous evening after a flight we hadn’t eaten dinner and so we’re looking forward to a tasty breakfast on Sunday morning before starting our long drive home.

Plus the details of what we would get discount on if we ate in the restaurant by the receptionist was wrong and misleading.

Paid almost £300 for room with lounge access, thinking it would be similar to the airport. Nope. Lounge access included fruit, some olives and pretzels, chilled soft drinks, tea and coffee. Had to ask for coffee cups and still waiting for spoons. Ended up a few of us using ""the spoon"" and washing it between uses! Once the canapes came out we thought it would get better. Instead around 20 of us shared around 40 canapes, most of which tasted like something warmed up from Iceland. Ended up going in search of food, where we chose the ""2 for £20"", and were attempted to be charged almost £58 with VAT and tips! Food ok, nothing more. Told when we came down to breakfast that, because it was early, only cold platter on,  which was nice but we wouldn't have paid for it if we'd have known before hand. Also supposed to have private check in but not available due to staff training.....

The menu doesn't state anywhere what items are suitable for vegans as we had already discovered from looking at it from outside. Not the kind of service you would expect .

I asked if we could have a runway view and the grumpy chap on the phone muttered something about needing an executive suite but would show us a different room. 15 minutes later I went down stairs to get keycard and after popping in the back office, the friendlier lass on reception said the grumpy chap was dealing with another customer but gave us new key cards.

Cold buffet food and no waiter came to ask if we wanted any eggs cooking.  We didn't even get offered any coffee or tea!  A total cost of £298.50 for this?  Outrageous.

Paid for the upgraded room for the runway view, instead I was given non-runway view.
As a result of this, we had to go back to lobby to ask for the correct room and I ended up bringing charged twice.
We asked about the parking, and informed them that we had parked in the Radisson car park and was advised it was free? We put this down to the errors that they had made and the fact we were made to wait.

Went to the room (we had booked a premium room with runway view) and we had been given a room overlooking the front of the hotel. I went back to reception and spoke to the same receptionist and advised it wasn’t the room we had booked.

I’ve made the point before when completing these surveys that it’s almost like your penalized for booking via Booking.com when being placed in your room.  The room also had an adjoining door which I don’t like.  
Every time you ordered from the restaurant, room service or at breakfast you were asked if you’d left a deposit against your card at the desk when checking in.  Seems to me having already done that that they should know and not keep asking.  It’s an expensive hotel with a big name and reputation for service but that is not always apparent. 
I asked for ice cream to be added to a desert being ordered from room service.  The answer was no as they did not have access to the ice cream.  I understand the need to limit the menu at certain times but to not be able to add ice cream because they can’t have access to it suggests a bigger problem which is somewhat worrying.",6.7,Pleasant

We then moved to another room and it did not work there either, consequently it was 25c in the room through the night...too hot to sleep.  Because we waited while they tried to repair the air con food had stopped being served in the bar, you could only get a pizza.  We had to go for the only option which was room service....big mistake, two soups and two burgers which were cold and cost us £50, yes that's right £50 for a pile of cold food.

We asked for maintenance to help.  A man eventually turned up, telling us that the bedside light was part of a unit, which had to be replaced completely, so couldn't be mended with a new bulb.  Minutes after he left, another lamp began to flash on and off.  He came with a bulb and changed it, telling us he was the only person on for the whole hotel.  Within minutes it was flashing again.  
We went to dinner, hoping this would improve our pre-holiday experience.  The service was exemplary, but the food was quite dreadful.  And, unfortunately, breakfast was not much better the following morning.

Our bathroom was dirty and in the bedroom the bedside lights were covered on dust and the hairdryer was broken!!!!🙁 The cooked breakfast was cold and I have never before had the displeasure of such revolting scrambled egg.

View of runway paid extra and had to use binoculars to see it.  TV in room would not switch off so every time we did it turned on again after 5 minutes ... we could not turn it off at a socket as the workings were behind a board.  Complained and told they could have come up an disconnected it for us but then we would have needed it reconnected at 5am when we got up ... no compensation offered.

No apologies for the confusion, no explanation on how to this, no consideration of whether we had the possibility of doing this. Room had minimal considering cost and fact we couldn't really go anywhere but hotel. Went to bar for some overpriced chips but they forgot about them, meaning they arrived cold, half an hour later.

The response was they were new TV’s and were still ‘configuring’ ... what rubbish. Also told to unplug. This was not possible as tv was hard wired into the wall. The most basic function of any hotel is to provide an environment that allows for a good nights rest. The inability of the TV’s to be switched off, resulting in the room being lit up all night ensured this could not happen.

The room was spacious and the bed was so comfy. Very clean.
In general the staff is very friendly and helpful."," Booked Executive room and was disappointed about the service and approach for the amount over 200 GBP. Check-in at reception Level 9. Waiting time not acceptable. Just one guest in front, but receptionist was not bothered to speed up the process. Was talking about this and that endless. The approach was not business oriented. May some customer feel pampered and as a VIP having a chat, but I prefer to have an efficient check in. Check out was the same, one guest in front and waiting time. I had to ask if I can check out also at main reception. Another guest was in the lift and said that he is not happy about the odd approach. At the main reception I was not even ask if I enjoyed my stay. Only that all is set.
Had ask at the evening if I can get a Coffee to go in the Executive lounge early morning and when I have been there at 6:30am were no Cups to go available. The staff at Exc. reception was arguing that its not usual and they only have coffee in the lounge. Sorry but this is a simple task and I had ask before. She found finally a cup, but was not happy about my request. Gave me the impression that I had better not ask about.",7.1,Could be better

The young man who booked us in was exceptional, professional and friendly and probably the best thing about the stay."," A lot of the staff especially in the bar and restaurant are unfriendly and not at all well trained in customer service. It's as though they believe they are doing you a favour.  Also the restaurant is really bad food.  I had fish that was served with sweet potato and lime pickle.  It should have been a lovely dish but was a pile of overboiled cubes of sweet potato with no flavour at all, a small lukewarm piece of fish and a dried up piece of lime !!! When I told the waiter he just shrugged and said he would tell the chef.  No apology and they just charged for it.  Third time I've risked food in the restaurant and nothings improved.",7.1,Not much choice if you have to stay at the airport. This is the best location.

4721,United States of America,Superior Room with Runway View,1 night ,October 2018,Solo traveler," I have stayed here before and returned because of the location and because of the friendliness of the staff. The location is still a key factor for me, but the restaurant has been completely changed since we were here last fall and that was a disappointment. The restaurant staff were nice, but decidedly amateur. The receptionist at check in was very friendly and efficient, on the other hand."," The bar staff were horrendous! Clearly the two men on duty were not in the least bit interested in being there, in being attentive and polite to customers. They were brusque and dour in my interactions with them. And this was not a particularly busy night! I can forgive a lot in an airport hotel food and drink service in the height of tourist season, when servers are inundated by loud, demanding crowds. But this was a weeknight in October and the bar was pleasantly busy, not overcrowded. The attitude of the bar servers desperately needs changing.  As representatives of the hotel, they don't serve it well, to say the least.",7.1,"Good for an airport hotel,  but some staff need attitude and service training!"
4722,United Kingdom,Standard Room,1 night ,September 2018,Couple, Fast and efficient check in.  Room standard and cleanliness was very good. Location for an early morning flight cannot be beaten.," Being seated in the restaurant seemed to be beyond the capabilities of the staff. After standing around for 10 minutes as the queue grew and with barely an acknowledgement from one of the waiters who asked us to wait ‘for someone who was trained’ (“in what?” we would have liked to ask before he scurried off), we abandoned the exercise and foraged for food in the airport terminal shops and took it back to our room.  Appalling.",7.0,Ok for an overnight stay at airport.  Bring your own food.

Offered us a different room and by the time we got into bed again it was 1:30 AM and we had a wake up call at 7 AM. We were just falling asleep when the TV burst into life.

4728,New Zealand,Executive Room with Lounge Access,1 night ,September 2018,Couple, The room and bed was comfortable., The girl checking us in on the executive floor asked if we wanted an early morning wake up call.  As we were checking in at 6am we asked for one at 5am.  It never materialised and if I hadn't woken early at 5.20am we could have slept right through and missed the flight.  As it was we started the day rushing round and getting stressed.  If we had known we would have set our own alarm on our phone which I would recommend everyone else doing. I just didn't expect it in a hotel of this calibre.,6.2,Needlessly stressful.

At 6:30 in the morning the recycling was being collected which was very loud crashing noises of glass for quite a while which woke me up ( out of the hotels control which is fair enough), luckily I dosed off only for house keeping to come barging through the door at 7:10 in the morning!! Then later on coming out of the bathroom I came face to face with the people cleaning the windows abseiling down the building! I asked at the reception if it was normal for house keeping to come in that early which they said it wasn’t and then was shrugged off with a “oh sorry about that”. Surely if someone hasn’t checked out and I had breakfast ordered for 9:30 this should be a good indication not to try and enter someone’s room! it’s a shame as I always look for a Radisson Blu whenever I travel for business or with my family, and I can’t help but feel let down with the experience this time.",6.7,Pleasant

The hotel staff are also very friendly and helpful.," It's a good place to stay for a night before a trip which to me is the biggest selling point of this hotel. For the price of it though, some things could have been better. The heating in the room was broke so I had to request to get that fixed, give them their due it was sorted and they sent an engineer up straight away who managed to fix it. There was no access to drinking water in the room and the mini-bar in the fridge was empty. There was a used tissue under the bed as well and a massive sheet of dust so it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in ages. I wouldn't have looked underneath otherwise because the bed sheets tend to cover it up but I always check under the bed before I leave to make sure I haven't left anything behind and that's when I discovered the aforementioned.

At breakfast its basically self service but also a little menu on your table should you want anything cooking separately such as an omelette of your choice, breakfast muffin etc, but the thing is, no-one EVER comes back to you to ask if you do want to order anything? So, I go to the self service for the full english, but the only eggs on display are scrambled so I hesitated, do I fill my plate with other food then try to order the fried eggs I wanted? All waiters are busy so I ask a girl who has just come out of the kitchen if I could order fried eggs - she indicated I needed to ask a waiter so after hovering for a while with an empty plate I managed to speak to a passing waiter to put my order in - he was polite and said they would be 2 mins. Fine but do I go and wait at my table for them or start loading my plate with the other items I wanted? I didnt want my food going cold. No one tells you anything!! All it needs is a waiter to explain at your table how to order, either off the menu or extra to whats on display, then for him to return to you to check what you want to do.

5245,Isle of Man,,1 night ,December 2019,Family, Breakfast manager was friendly and very efficient and breakfast was delicious, We arrived late on a Friday which is why I presume we were given an unrequested room for someone with a type of disability which allows you to be able to walk to the very end of the corridor furthest from the lift but not get in a bath. The wet room was outdated with a small shower that you have to be able to stand up in or happily shower your means of mobility!!!,5.0,"Great location, great food, friendly staff, need to rethink accessibility for guests"

5247,United Kingdom,,1 night ,December 2019,Couple, Beds themselves were very comfortable. We didn’t take breakfast as at £17.00 we felt this was very expensive. Room rate was a little over the top at £144 which would put us off using it in the future unless we were forced to do so due to a very early flight. A more reasonable room rate would be appreciated, Breakfast rate too expensive. Room comfortable but definitely not worth £144,7.0,"Convenient for an early flight.

5250,British Virgin Islands,,1 night ,December 2019,Solo traveler, The location was good and the room was excellent.

Check in was very slow.",6.7,Cold rooms which remain chilly despite adjustment + pathetic excuse for breakfast delivered to room
5254,United Kingdom,,1 night ,October 2019,Couple, The location," Staff didn’t communicate availability of facilities (including parking and room service) well enough. Nearly overcharged despite booking through booking.com. Milk in the room was out of date by 5 months. Pillows and towels stained. Staff polite, but did nothing to rectify any of the issues.",4.6,Disappointing
5255,Austria,,1 night ,September 2019,Family," Liked everything except check in and check out- breakfast  (and staff at breakfast) excellent, room fine with a few tiny but unimportant flaws, location superb for airport customers. Pricey but would have been worth it for ease and convenience as a stop-over point coming from/ going to the airport at awkward times when taking the train. Unfortunately was not the case."," Disastrous check in and out- arriving at 1 in the morning with my 82 year old mother who just wanted to get to bed after travelling -were endlessly held up by a failure to process card payment because (we were told) they had had an update to their system - after 30 minutes of messing around they told us that it was ok and when I asked for a receipt they told us that was just a prepayment confirmation (?) and we'd have to return in the morning. Finally got to bed annoyed and delayed for a few hours sleep. 
Cue next day- a repeat performance which, had I not factored in time for trouble at the desk, would have meant we would have missed our train. The morning receptionists didn't know ""anything"" about an update and gave the impression it was the card's fault. My mother was extremely distressed at the thought that maybe someone had got at her accounts (we tried 2 cards) and emptied them while we were away.
 After great delay and being looked at like we couldn't pay, ultimately saved by one receptionist who went to the manager and retrieved a hand-held device to process the payment (which worked in seconds). The whole thing took so long both times my mother had to go and sit down as she was unable stand that long, followed by a dash to the train which she could have done without. 
Huge shame as the point of staying there for a few hours of sleep at a rather high price had been for her comfort and ease and to provide a charming end to the holiday. Instead she got on the train upset and stressed out. Perhaps should have used the stay's cost for a taxi home instead....",6.2,"Good idea in theory, ruined by the check in and out"

We missed the last orders for the restaurant and were told we could order room service. However, upon checking in to our room and ringing for room service we were told it would take over an hour. Since we had a very early start the next morning we couldn't wait up that late. There is nowhere else nearby to eat at that time. So we had to settle for a packet of crisps in the bar as there was absolutely nothing else to be had.

5275,United Kingdom,,1 night ,March 2019,Solo traveler, Easy access to terminal for very early morning flight., I prepaid on arrival as I didn't want to waste time on checking out due to a very early flight.

5285,United Kingdom,,1 night ,November 2018,Solo traveler, This is was pretty basic for a Radisson Blu hotel. Empty mini-bar. Very expensive for what it offers., Poorly staffed reception.,6.2,Not value for money
5286,United Kingdom,,1 night ,November 2018,Group, Convenience, Lifts permanently broken. Only 3 for the whole hotel but one is permanently closed whilst renovations take place on it. The other two were constantly not working. A lot of guests including us had large cases and as there are 9 floors it was a complete nightmare. Eventually a man came and took us to the staff lifts behind the scenes but leaving the hotel from the 7th floor was awful as the lift every time it came was full ! There was no one you could phone to pick your luggage up as the phone in our room wasn’t working and a distinct lack of staff to help you with cases. We reported the phone the previous night but no one came. Would never stay again.,7.1,Good
5287,United Kingdom,,1 night ,October 2018,Solo traveler, Very comfortable bed. Friendly restaurant staff but very few staff both in lobby and in restaurant for this type of hotel.," Very slow check-in and check-out
Restaurant was over-priced.",5.0,Fair
5288,United Kingdom,,1 night ,September 2018,Couple, THE BED WAS VERY COMFY., RESTAURANT VERY EXPENSIVE.,7.1,EXCELLENT LOCATION IF YOU ARE FLYING FROM MANCHESTER AIRPORT.
5289,United Kingdom,,1 night ,October 2018,Family, Quick check in and excellent room service, Bed uncomfortable. Poor stocked bar,6.7,Pleasant
5290,United Kingdom,,1 night ,September 2018,Couple,, Room service very slow and food cold when it did arrived.,6.7,Pleasant
5291,Canada,,1 night ,September 2018,Couple, It was within walking distance to the train station and the airport.," Over priced! Bed was horrible! - about as comfy as sleeping on the floor. A few of the lights didn't work. It could use a USB wall plug at the desk. The blow dryer didn't easily work (although could have been an anti - theft feature??). The fridge was warmer than the room A/C. And the food!?!? Even worse then the bed! Few chips I got were ok, fish was soggy with grease. My husband's lamb chops were ok but for £18 ""special"" you should get a vegetable - well you could...for an extra £4!! Luckily we only needed it for 1 night!",4.2,Unless you need to be at the airport early - consider staying elsewhere
5292,United Kingdom,,1 night ,October 2018,Couple," Nothing,  worst hotel experience ever.",,2.5,Very Poor
5293,United Kingdom,,1 night ,September 2018,Solo traveler, The staff and location," The room was no better than a
Premier inn and the snacks in the executive lounge were awful NOT worth 178 pounds !!",7.1,Good
5294,United Kingdom,,1 night ,September 2018,Group, The beds were very comfortable., The shower leant to the left therefore had to take it off the stand to use it properly.  The restaurant did not seem prepared when we were there for breakfast.  We had to ask for tea and coffee. No teaspoons available for drinks. Scrambled eggs were not available when I attended the buffet.,6.7,Pleasant
5295,United Kingdom,,1 night ,September 2018,Couple," Location was very convenient. We had an early morning flight the following morning. The hotel was  clean,staff were polite and a friendly.Early morning call was requested and this worked well for us.", Overpriced for room only.,7.1,Convenient stay for airport to catch an  early flight the following morning
5296,United Kingdom,,1 night ,September 2018,Couple, Room was good, Food was expensive in restaurant over priced for quality of the food.Breakfast was cold,6.7,Pleasant
5297,United Kingdom,,1 night ,September 2018,Couple, Room was comfortable, Food was horrific and over priced. Reception staff the morning of checkout very rude when we fedback that the room service sent up was cold and inedible.,5.8,"Comfy room, vile food, rude staff."
5298,United Kingdom,,1 night ,August 2018,Couple, Close to our terminal for an early flight. It was very quiet.," Tv was stuck half on (glowing) but not responding - had to call maintenance. The duvet was feather even though I had requested NOT feathers. The drinks tray offer was limited e.g only one of some items for a 2-person stay. Dust in the drawer. Big bed, but with a huge sharp ridge down the middle.",7.1,Overpriced and disappointing
5299,United Kingdom,,1 night ,August 2018,Family, Closeness to airport," Not many facilities for children, bar very noisy and no where quiet to sit and relax. Food very expensive.",5.8,Okay but expensive
5300,United Kingdom,,1 night ,August 2018,Family, Location and pool, Expensive for what it it. Food and drink menu was limited and overpriced,7.1,Radisson blu
5301,United Kingdom,,1 night ,August 2018,Family, Location extremely handy for the airport and train station, Airport view is more of a carpark view. Overpriced food and drink just because of the location,6.7,Pleasant
5302,United Kingdom,,1 night ,August 2018,Couple, Lovely room., There was no available gluten free options despite it being advertised online that they were available.  I booked specifically with the Radisson for this reason.,6.7,Not suitable for coeliacs.
