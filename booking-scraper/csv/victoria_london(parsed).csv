On arrival we have been told by receptionist Ana-Maria that it's not available due to other guest who stayed in the hotel through loyalty programme wanted to stay extra night. We were suggested to pay extra and stay in 2 bedroom apartment instead. I did say that we have payed already for one bedroom apartment so it should be one available at least without view (must admit we have booked this hotel based on conversation over the phone that this type of appartment is available for our stay). We have been offered to switch the apartment next day if this guest will leave. We have done this, but the room had no balcony as the one that we stayed the night before, so I believe receptionist had herself confused as to which appartments have balconies and which not.

Loads of shops and places to eat only mins from hotel. You're kind of 10 mins in a cab from everywhere - covent garden etc. Defo recommend this hotel, we will be back 100%.

However, on arrival, the lady on the concierge told us there was no such request on their system! Strange since I had email confirmation to remind them on arrival! We were offered a different room upgrade to what we had requested that didn't suit so we declined. The reception on checking-in was less than friendly - almost clinical! However, checking-out and porter staff were excellent.
The bathroom in our room was looking tired - a cracked floor tile and mastic around the bath heavily peeling away with a small amount of mould staining.

What the hotel does own is its car park, and access to this is via a lift - yes a car lift (capacity 4000 kg) which is so narrow that the parking sensors would not stop.

Bathroom has issues - the shower door is not engineered properly to prevent water from pouring out on floor - we had to use bath mat and one huge towel to prevent water from running out onto entry carpet.
Lighting - room is TOO DARK - the entry and closet areas are so dark we couldn't see to deal with clothing in the closet. Room itself needs brighter light - we were trying to read documents and had a great deal of trouble.
Room chair - can the weird quasi-recliner and put in a comfortable chair or love seat.

Things like, missing battery covers on tv remotes, wifi that doesn't work in some rooms, a terrible odor coming from the bathroom, showers that flood bathroom floors, and a few other things.
The bathrooms are really starting to show their age. They look dingy and unfinished. The tile grout is gray from years of use. The bathroom looks like a high school gym locker room.  These a worn telephone next to the toilet in case you need to make a call while doing your business.
When I would take a shower, the 1/2 gap under the shower door would flood the floor. I would use all my clean towels to try and stop the River Nile from overflowing. (This is what made me decide I'm done booking rooms here.)",7.5,Quality is sliding downward but a decent place to stay in Victoria.

They ended up giving me a meat breakfast no meat and all that was was an egg hash brown and spinach so I’m very disssapointed. It would be nice if different dietary needs were taken into consideration and treated more equally, for example veggie bacon or veggie sausage. I do not understand why porridge is deemed as an appropriate alternative to a fry up."," As above, the COVID breakfast wasn’t great. I booked the hotel because the breakfast looked good, when I got there I was told the veggie option was porridge which is insane. Issues with the coffee maker and it only filled my cup halfway. There was no toast or no option/offer to have toast which would have been nice for me as I only had an egg spinach and some hash browns. Bread is cheap!
There was orange juice but no apple juice and the orange juice was served in tiny glasses which were not full.

I questioned the manager as she shrugged her shoulders and said ""I know"", blaming management's decision - so that people could take coffee's away if they wanted. In the time I was sat there I watched staff use these cups for their drinks, children use them as pen pots and many of them cleared into waste by breakfast staff - unbelievably wasteful and not eco-friendly.

Nice quiet room."," The bathroom needed a better exhaust. It was impossible to stay in the bathroom after a shower, far too humid. I didn't like the shower over the bath, far too dangerous, & the screen was not wide enough to keep the floor dry.
I was sick with the flu during our 5 day stay, so we asked the male concierge for advice regarding nearest doctor & chemist. For the doctor he suggested that we go to one that would require a 15 minute cab drive & similar for the chemist. However, we found a doctor just 5 minutes walk away, & she dispensed the antibiotics herself! The concierge estimated that his recommended doctor would charge about 80 pounds, whereas the one we found charged just 60.

Its a shame this experience did not measure up. I'd booked an 'Executive Studio' but failed to identify what made it 'executive'.

1185,Australia,One Bedroom Apartment,4 nights ,June 2019,Couple," We like the position of this hotel - very close to Victoria Station. Its foyer and some other features suggest a five star establishment, but it is a different story once you are in your ageing and tatty room.
The restaurant serves excellent Italian food, although it is also used for breakfasts, which are chaotic and of poor quality."," Where do we start? The staff are reminiscent of Manuel from Fawlty Towers - although his command of English and perception of guest needs were superior. The fact that it is virtually impossible to find a staff-member whose first language is English means that much is lost in the translation (either deliberately or otherwise). Our one-bedroom apartment (almost 350 pounds a night) could have been good if re-furbished, but it was in an appalling state of disrepair, with cupboard doors and drawers chipped and mal-aligned, a non-working dishwasher, large gouges out of the wooden floor (and parts of it that had lifted off completely), doors that didn't shut properly, a pungent and sickening influx of onion and garlic cooking smells several times a day, tatty furniture, no table to eat at, missing and mis-matched cutlery - the list goes on! The advertised coffee pods were not replaced each day (until we asked), and our bathrobes were removed during cleaning on the second day and had to be retrieved. The housekeeping was perfunctory and erratic. An extra 12.5% was added to our room service bill (not mentioned in the menu) and the quality of the food was mediocre. We took friends to the hotel's breakfast on one morning, and it was embarrassing - tired quintessential English greasy (and cold) hot dishes (one slice or two of congealed scrambled eggs? - with slightly exotic dishes such as eggs benedict or espresso coffee an extra cost). We reported the non-working dishwasher and onion smells to housekeeping and were assured that ""maintenance"" would look at it, but nothing happened.
All of this might have been predictable and tolerable had we been paying a third of the tariff we were charged, but it was unacceptble for the price.

The reception areas have been updated (in the style of Citizen M) but the rooms are sadly dated," Check in was laborious - the two guys on the desk seemed to find it amusing to keep me waiting until they'd dealt with 'their issue'. There was no one else checking in and from what I could see, they weren't dealing with anything at all - just reveling in the fact they were keeping me waiting. 'Wait over there - we're busy with somethin' was the abrupt order. Not what I was expecting after flying back from Sydney. I was then advised I needed to come back down to reception before 2pm the next day to ensure I could keep my room for the 2nd night - even though I'd paid 2 nights in advance.  When I went to reception the staff member couldn't work out why I'd come to see them. I then asked for a 2nd room key as the one I had kept faulting and I didn't want to take the lift 9 floors to reception each time my door wouldn't open. The guy on the desk looked completely confused. Why is that so odd? The apartment needs redecorating - it looks tired and the air-con doesn't work in the lounge so it was very hot.

Now bearing in mind that I was checking out the next morning, I was offered:
1: A change of room which I declined
2: The bathrobe and slippers were then sent up
3: A bottle of wine for the inconvenience 
4: Extra points added to my Radisson account 
50th Birthday Celebration in a nice hotel already ruined.
Jumped in the shower to finally settle down for the evening to find the flannels had been taken and not replaced.
And then just to cap it off just before check out,
Empty condom and viagra packets were found behind the television cabinet.

1236,Germany,Superior Queen Room,2 nights ,December 2018,Couple,," We booked our room via booking.com, and we chose the option to pay in Euro. On check-in day, they did not get the money, but on the check-out day, and it was 14 Euros more ( apparently due to the exchange rate, happened in only two days!!!). Their logic was that ""it is how it works"" !!: To charge the customers on the check-out day! Nonsense! As if they have the only hotel in the world and people have not seen other hotels before. 
The price in Pounds, however, was the same, but the important point was that we chose the option of Euro, for a certain amount,  and just that certain amount, not more. People call it a ""deal"". Apparently they do not care about this term in this hotel with their payment policy!
Furthermore,  they booked 50 pounds from our credit card for the stuff in the mini bar,  that's okay, but then put something in it too!

I asked why I wasn't told this before and the reply was I thought that was obvious!!

1247,Croatia,Superior Double Room,3 nights ,November 2018,Group, Bed was good and room size," My friend booked the room from 16.-19. November. The first night was paid in advance, so we only had to pay for 2 nights. When we came to hotel, we wanted to pay straight away, but the receptionist refused. He asked for a credit card for pre-authorization and we wanted to give the one we already paid the first night with, but he didn't want to take it. He insisted on another one instead. I gave him mine and asked what will he do with it and he said he won't take any money from it, it is only the guarantee we will pay for our stay. Next, I checked my bank account and it showed that the hotel took amount of money for 2 nights (including the deposit). I complained to another receptionist and she said the money isn't taken but ""frozen"".  Next thing, my friend's father informed her that the hotel called him on his phone and asked if he wants to pay for the rest 2 nights with that same card (the one we used for first night and the one they didn't want to take for pre-authorization) and he refused, because he knew they already have frozen our money. On Sunday we went to inform the reception about this behaviour and that we are shocked that you have guests in your hotel willing to pay, and you refuse it and then call someone who isn't there at all to pay. We explained everything all over again to another receptionist, and she apologized and asked if we want to pay now and I agreed. They said they will make the payment from frozen amount of money, but they took ANOTHER amount of money from my card which means I paid DOUBLE. I complained again to the chief desk officer and she said she will talk to accountant first thing on Monday to release the money and it will be in 3-5 working days back. TWO WEEKS passed already and my money is still missing. This can be treated as stealing.

It is easy to catch the underground from Heathrow, changing at Hammersmith (just cross the platform for the Circle Line there) with relatively few steps to negotiate with luggage at Victoria. You can walk to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abby, Houses of Parliament, Whitehall etc, and catch tube connections to other destinations in London. There is a nice lobby in the hotel and it is in a quiet location, with comfortable rooms. There are shops (even a large Sainsburies) and restaurants close by. The Italian themed restaurant in the hotel is first class, and we thought that the room service was good quality. Overall we enjoyed the experience. It is pricey, but that is London."," We would stay here again because of the location, but the hotel could be even better if only there were more attention to some details. We stayed in a spacious one bedroom suite, with self-catering facilities. However, the carpets were filthy and torn/threadbare, the wooden floor in the lounge area was heavily damaged, the dishwasher didn't work (and wasn't fixed in the four days we stayed after reporting this) some light globes needed replacing, the furniture was very knocked about and internal doors were heavy to open and shut. The blind for the bathroom window was broken and the washbasin sprayed water in all directions (again, not attended to even though we had asked for it to be fixed). We needed to ask for sugar sachets (twice). Staff were friendly, but for most English was clearly their second language, and we suspect that some things just got lost in translation. What could have been an exceptional hotel (it has all the basics) was a little Fawlty Tower-ish in some aspects.

3) Requested adjoining rooms- unavailable.

5)Moved to another room, which was "" ....ready."" with nonfunctioning minibar, no kettle, missing pillows.
6) Moved to ""executive room"". Same size as other rooms if not smaller, but executive because of coffee machine robe and slippers. Rusty faucet.

8) Cost to stay at hotel is misleading and implies high standards and quality.
9) After seeing four rooms at the establishment, the conclusion is:
There is no standard of room set-up,  cleanliness is lacking. Implying that proper inspection is not taking place.
Housekeeping Staff and room service work in disconnect and see no reason to excel at their job, because of lack of incentive.

always have two rooms sometimes up to four rooms at a time. It’s very
central and convenient for everything. However last time we stayed
earlier this year we felt things in the hotel were looking a little
shabby and tired, we noticed a difference of amenities in each of the
rooms even though two were supposed to be the same. This time we have
had four rooms three the same and one different type, again totally
different amenities, simple things like slippers in some but not all, no
ironing board in one but it had an iron, no face clothes in any
something there has always been in the past. Lack of loo roll, lack of
clean towels. We were asked when we checked in how many days we would
not like housekeeping, as we were there for five nights we agreed only
one, we were given a voucher worth £10 per room for money off our lounge
bar bill in exchange for no housekeeping. We in fact only had our rooms
cleaned twice and that was after we called reception to report there had
been no housekeeping done! As for the voucher you would think that would
be straight forward but no we only ended up have £2 removed from our bar
bill, (this was rectified at reception when we checked out!) I
appreciate Work needs to be carried out at some point but out of the
five days only once did all four lifts work usually only two, surly
August is a busy month to be doing such work and the reception desk was
blocked off with a small temporary one being used. We felt things on the
whole have slipped a lot on this trip, which is a great same as we have
always enjoyed our stays here.",5.4,Fair

1305,Germany,Superior Double Room,4 nights ,August 2018,Family," Excellent location, very close to Victoria Station, a bunch of nice restaurants and pubs right next door. Staff was very friendly, yet in some situations overwhelmed."," There were a lot of minor flaws, which summed up to an overall disappointment. The rooms were said to be ready by 2.00 Pm, we arrived at 3:30 and the larger room was still not done. It took more than an additional hour before we were let into the room. The large room (I think it was called junior suite) was an annex on the roof and had two sides of windows and a flat roof. That caused the room to heat up quickly, during the hot days in this year's August the air conditioning could not cope with that. The cleaning staff opened the blinds every day so that the room heated up all day.
The bathroom needs renovation, the mirrors show large areas of rust. The shower cabin was severely leaking so the bathroom was flooded after each shower. 
There were no spots to hang the towels. There was no power outlet near a mirror, so using a blow dryer was kind of impossible. 
When opening the room door, the light in the bathroom was lit. It could only be switched off from a panel next to the bed - that means there was no way to discretely leave the room when one person woke up earlier, without waking the others up.
None of these flaws were major, but all in all our stay did not match the aspiration level of a park plaza hotel - nor did it match the paid price.",7.1,"Excellent location, but does not live up to the aspiration level"
1306,United Kingdom,Superior Queen Room,1 night ,August 2018,Solo traveler,," Phone did not work, no soap in the bathroom and no hotel guide. Mini-bar was empty and I could not close the window. Hotel is close to a busy road and Victoria Station.",6.2,Pleasant

1309,United Kingdom,Superior Queen Room,1 night ,August 2018,Couple, The room was nice," The food was absolutely disgusting! 
The cleaners knocked 3 times in the morning asking what time did we check out from 10:30 this happened when check out is at 12!
It was meant to be a chilled morning as we have young kids we wanted to make the most of the time to ourselves.! This was extremely annoying!!!
Also the lift for the car park was a joke just waiting for ages for them to open.
And then when you get to the car park downstairs it's like a car boot sale.
I've been to park plazas lots of times & they've been great but this one put them to shame. Worst experience ever.",5.4,It was awful not much more to say

1311,United States of America,Superior Double Room,6 nights ,August 2018,Solo traveler,," The location was the only good thing about this hotel. But here are some bad things that I have experienced during my stay at this hotel. First night: I was in a room on the third floor. The room and furniture were literally shaking and about to collapse whenever the door in the next room was opened and closed, like an earthquake. I asked them to change it and they did, and believe or not, they said it’s so common in their hotel to hear from residents about the doors problem. Second issue: After three nights, I decided to extend my stay due to a flight change, so the hotel pre-charged my credit card 5 times during my stay!! (Before the check out time!) totally charged me for more than a double of the whole total amount of the stay. When I complained and met the duty manager, he said there is an error in the system !! And to be honest he didn’t say the truth cuz these transactions are done manually. I asked them to hold the whole amount for the stay just once, and release the rest of holding money that they hold without any reason or right! He said apologized about what happened and said okay but he didn’t know when these amount supposed to get back to my card, therefore, I was so limited financially on my card until the time of writing this comments. Third issue, with the bed: the cover sheet and pillows’ sheets smell bad, they smell like a forgotten wet towel on the couch for days without getting it dried. I asked them to change them all, the did in the next day!! Third issue: they don’t put a new bag and form for the laundry again in the closet it you already used them. So you have to call every time to ask them to bring a bad & form to put in the closet in order to use them next time. Honestly, this is NOT a good hotel to stay at when you come to London whether for a vacation or business trip!",5.4,Fair

Also, specific dietary requirements for one of our party were met with a professional and reassuring attitude."," A small point for the hotel's consideration; glass wash basins in the room, which so obviously display unsightly plumbing underneath; they can also be relatively dangerous when stooping.  Also discolouration of taps; they are spotlessly clean - they just don't look clean!",8.8,... and an ideal location for our purposes.

Much better service and customer friendly than some of the other Park Plaza near them.  
  
It would be my choice again if i were to visit london with the family."," House Keeping team is not available after certain hours, and hence you need to call or go down and see the front desk to request for something. Would have been good to have their number automatically transfer to the front desk during those hours.

Also, I appreciate it is during the pandemic but a four star hotel surely shouldn't be serving food in cardboard with plastic cutlery. The restaurants are open, so why can't the hotel do as they do. It felt like a lazy response to me. 
Lastly, the bar was only serving miniatures. As with the restaurants; the bars are all open, why is the hotel insisting on serving miniatures in plastic glasses. No one else is.",4.0,Disappointing

Our view consisted of a back alley full of buns and rubbish!
The toilet seat was wobbly
Water in the ice bucket which I presume was left by the last occupant!

1457,Germany,,2 nights ,May 2019,Group, The location near to Victoria Station and the Pain Quotidien opposite - a great place for breakfast., The 'smart' room control system is not user-friendly. What's the matter with an old-fashioned light switch? Lack of hotel information in the room. Apparently the hotel has a gym and a spa but we couldn't find anything about it. Staff seem indifferent. Polite enough but that's all. If I book this hotel again it will be purely because of its convenient location. Definitely not like the Park Plaza of old!,6.2,Pleasant
