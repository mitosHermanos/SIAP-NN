101,Nigeria,Junior Suite with Lounge Access,6 nights ,January 2021,Family, I particularly liked the location of the hotel. The neighborhood was friendly and really modern. The hotel also had a clear view of the Burj Kalifa which was great for viewing the new year's day fireworks. Also the staff were extremely helpful in every situation., The major thing I didn't like was that I didn't get any rewards point for staying in the hotel because the booking was made through a third party (Booking.com). That was quite disappointing but unfortunately it's the hotel policy even though it's one that I think should be changed. I have booked other hotels through booking.com and gotten my rewards point. That's why I am scoring this hotel experience low on value. Also some African dishes should be added to the breakfast menu to make it truly international.,7.0,Great stay without the rewards points

Rooms are spacious and clean. Swimming pool is not too big but perfectly okay for a short swim (water very nice warm). Also for relaxing time the area is big enough.
Access to the business lounge is great. Between 17:00 and 19:00 food and drinks (alcohol included) for free. Breakfast here is also fine and quiet. 
The staff jn the business lounge is great and very helpful. My advice is to leave a small tip when you leave. Will be very much apriciated. 
If you need taxi take a regular one (just ask for it and staff will arrange one). The private taxis at the hotel are 2.5 time more expensive. 
Area is close to the down town (Burj Khalifa) = 15 Dirham by taxi = 10 minutes. To the La Mer beach = 25 Dirham = 15 minutes.  
To the Atlanis (Palm Beach) = 30 minutes = 70 Dirham.

324,South Africa,Standard Room with Burj Khalifa View,1 night ,January 2020,Couple," The hotel is well located, in that it's close to Business Bay Metro station (a bit of a trek with a 20kg bag, but even with that, I actually walked from the Metro to the hotel and was quite alright). The staff are incredible at all times everywhere from check in to check out. The room (1518) was functional in design yet pretty. Amenities great. The Burj view is a great bonus if it's your first time to Dubai. The Makar was a lovely upperclass pub vibe for the evening, and a fun quiz night (although the content too long and complex for us after a day of travel) was a bonus. The Fireroom restaurant has incredible views - excellent food too. The hot water did not work in our first room for a day (my husband having arrived before me for work), so when I arrived the following day I asked them to attend to sorting that out. There was an engineering issue being resolved after a pipe burst or something (not something they can control or pre-plan for, so I don't see it as a negative). The staff quickly moved us to a much bigger suite on the 15th floor without hassle or charge. It made my first night in Dubai quite special."," My husband stayed for business before I joined him. He was on the 3rd floor above the Fire restaurant. He mentioned the restaurant keeps playing music until about 1am and he heard it echo in his room, so I would recommend a higher level room if you want a quieter experience.",8.0,Excellent city hotel

Located downtown, took me 12min by foot to the Dubai Mall (don't trust Google Maps, it does not take 45min by foot), plus Business Bay is nice for an evening stroll or jogging, with restaurants and supermarkets near by."," Honestly the 'main' elevators to/from the lobby suck as groups of people had to wait for up to 8min to even get into one - super crowded and two are simply not enough to handle so many guests plus luggage (not mentioning this 'first go up the whole way to then going back whilst stopping at every floor').

The breakfast offered a wide variety of high quality food..Everything was spotless clean in the restaurant and throughout the hotel..Housekeeping was extremely efficient..The gym was well-equipped and overlooked the waterfront as well..
The strongest asset of this hotel are its staff who get out of their way to please their guests with a big smile! Special thanks goes out to Belin at the reception frontdesk who was always corteous, helpful, very amiable and consistently made sure that I receive a VIP treatment..
I wish this hotel and its dedicated staff all the best in forthcoming years!

The bed was really good and everything was provided in the bathroom and tea & coffee facilities. The wee balcony made the room special with being able to enjoy the warm evening.
We were able to book activities and the tourist buses from the hotel lobby - the lady was really helpful. Best advice - get the local regulated taxis - these are cream coloured with a red roof. You won't get ripped off and taxiing is quite affordable.
The breakfast offered is amazing! Highly recommended - fabulous value for money. Huge variety including a local and children's section and from the menu. Seating inside or out on an expansive terrace with with a great view."," Our check-in was not straight forward. We were unsure what was offered and confused by what was include as part of a room up-grade, despite asking for it to be explained. In hindsight we were offered as part of the up-grade access to a lounge and breakfast that our arrival/departure flight times wouldn't have allowed us to use. As we were checking in at mid-night they should have know this. We emailed our questions though their app to sort this issue but there was no reply - this meant another visit to reception in the morning to sort out payment etc.  
The reception desk also did not point out that around the corner (in their own lobby!) there was a lady that could help with bookings/advice on all the tourist information. This was only pointed out by the man on the door because we asked him where we should go in our taxi!
We asked our doorman for a local taxi (see above) but he said that the one he put us in would not over charge us...he did. $50 with that one - mid morning no traffic, $23 same return trip - in heavy traffic that evening with a local (cream coloured with red roof)!",9.2,Wonderful

Secondly the cleaning staff isn’t attentive when cleaning our room because they didn’t leave a second toilet tissue roll even though the only one we had was almost finished. Had to call someone for this also in the night. This was embarrassing and disappointing.
Lastly (I thought this would be a bit obvious) there’s no list of important numbers to dial from your room to reach reception/service desk. So when we had to make the two late night calls, we just guessed and dialled zero.

They should either direct you immediately to the  concerned department or take in your query. Instead, they would take in your query in details then direct you and you have to repeat your query. For example I wanted room service, she asked me what I want to eat, then directed me to room service to take my order again. I wanted a ride so she took the details of the ride then connected me to concierge and I had to repeat again. Also, the check in was slow. The bed was too soft.",7.1,Good
829,United States of America,Standard Room,2 nights ,February 2019,Couple," We LOVED the general ambiance of the hotel and the friendly and well-informed staff.  We were met by Ferdi who immediately gave us some great information about places nearby--to eat and to visit.  He always was more than just informative and went out of his way to help us get oriented.  Also, we were helped very much by Roshan who was there at 5:00 am to help us with our luggage and get us off to the airport with coffee in our hands and sweet rolls, too.  Also, David was infinitely helpful in many questions we had and one of the reasons we canceled our other hotel at the airport and spent another night at Radisson Blu instead  Also, the location was superior and within walking distance of the Dancing Fountains, the Mall and the Burj Khalifa.
We ate one dinner there and it was delicious.  We ate during happy hour out on the front on the patio-- bar area.  We had mussels which were both beautifully cooked and served.  And a salad which was equally well presented.  The wine was well priced and a generous pour.  Very good value at happy hour."," We had mixed drinks at the poolside that were fairly expensive, even for a great hotel like Radisson Blu.  That's pretty much all that we could say was disappointing.  Everything else seemed very reasonable for a luxury hotel in a central spot.",10,A beautiful property in the business area of Dubai is centrally located for walking

The minibar wasn't complete with the goods upon check-in and at the time of check-out they tried to charge me for the items that weren't in the minibar. Of course, they didn't charge me for the items that were missing and I paid for only those that I consumed. The tables and seats in the outdoor area at The Larder must be changed.

I have confirmed the same room with the hotel staff prior to check in and they assured me in writing that I will retain the room for the entire duration of my stay. However, when we arrived the receptionist asked again about the bookings and I had to explain from the beginning what was the issue. We checked in into our room and while the view was nice, the room itself was:
- Very old
- Dusty and not clean
One day when we came to the room in the afternoon after an exhausting day exploring the city, we found that our key was not working. In other words, we were simply locked out of our room. I then remembered that it was the day when we were supposed to ""check out"" according to our first booking. And indeed, when we arrived at the reception they acted like they had no idea about the second booking. And to make it even ""better"" now they were saying that our second booking featured a STANDARD room, while we were staying at the premium room with Burj Khalifa view. I was completely shocked by such incompetence. After 40 minutes of arguing the issue was resolved, but I sure didn't want to spend my time like this on holidays. I'd expect a free breakfast or at least a drink in return to such horrible treatment, and the hotel didn't offer a single thing.

- Our bedsheets/bed linen were not changed the entire week

- At checkin-in the lady wasn't very kind, nor did she provide much info about the general things until we asked about them (which floor the breakfast is, which floor the pool is on, etc)
- We booked a room for 2 adults and 2 children. The sofa bed was not prepared, so we had to show our booking first that we had requested it before it was arranged. 
- We had luggage in the trunk of our renter car, as well as 1 piece of luggage on the backseat because it didn't fit. The only luggage brought to our room was the one from the back seat. Which is a human mistake that can happen. But then we were ready to leave, but had to wait an additional 20 min outside before they could take out the remaining luggage from our car. 
- Since they knew our booking was for 4 people, we found only 2 towels in the room. We complained and got 2 more towels. Then the next day we were again down to 2 towels. So we had to ask about it again. 
- The next day, the basic things such as shower gel, shampoo etc, weren't even refilled that were empty. The basic things you even get in a 3-star hotel could not be executed in this 5-star hotel. 
- We asked for a basic thin cover for our kids, because the one provided was one of those thick and warm fleece blankets. After 30 minutes waiting, a staff member shows up with the exact same blanket. I explain and show him that we already have that one, and that we would like a thinner one. Waiting another 15 minutes he just returns with the same one. 
- On our last evening we asked the reception if it would be possible to get a small package for breakfast, since we had to checkout the next morning at 5am. He said that it would be no problem, and it would be ready for us at checkout. Next morning, nothing was ready. And the staff member had to call the kitchen then to arrange it, and told us it would take 5 minutes. I waited 15 minutes, and then told them I had to leave for the airport.",2.0,A 5-star hotel with 1-star service. Terrible staff.
1152,United Kingdom,Standard Room,2 nights ,December 2020,Solo traveler, I had dinner in the Firelake Grill House on my first evening and it was really good.," I had breakfast in The Larder and it was awful. It's buffet service and it feels like a race by the staff to get you served and out.  If you find everything you want to eat as you enter the ""Buffet area"" that's luck. Anything, other than the food displayed is ordered and takes a while - 15 mins for a fried egg. I could have had scrambled eggs, but fancied a fried egg - 15 mins later, it arrived, after I had eaten the rapidly cooling bacon and mushrooms... I left soon after with indigestion.  
This is a Business meeting / conference type hotel and not for tourists, unless you want to be quite close to the Shopping malls, Burj Khalifa, etc. It' also good for smokers in Makar - the Scottish Bar. Not great if you are a non smoker. I didn't see any other smoking areas in Dubai....!!
Fortunately, I had spent the previous 9 days at another hotel near the Marina and the contrast is unbelievable...
BTW - I did speak to the hotel / manager ""Karri"" and whilst she listened and said "" I'll mail the manager of the Larder"" that was it. DON'T book here as you will be disappointed.",5.0,AVOID this Hotel

Hotel staff at the check-in was not friendly and communicated very badly, making me feel ripped-off by a third class hotel chain (which I don’t expect from R Blu!)
The building is not as clean as a typical R Blu, even dirty in some areas.
The breakfast could’ve been more diversified, almost no fruit, no pancakes etc. I at least expect some regional fruit like dates.
Cheap feel in the room, since the balcony door was broken in both rooms we had! The balcony safeguard was loose, so there goes the ‘safe-‘.

Regina at reception was incredible, loved her and I have more names to mention. Everything was goin well, until the last night I was in the hotel, I got stolen exactly 270 Euros from a bunch of euros notes I had, sure the robber would think that I would not notice but I knew exactly how much I had after I had withdrawn the amount and left the euros untouched.
Found my stuff moved in different ways including my paperwork and reading book took a different location on my desk. Having OCDs and being a true traveler as well as an ex, Hotel Manager for the same company, Radisson, I realized right on the spot that things were not the same order as I always observe things. It took hours to get me count my money as I would have never thought something like this can even happen until I was packing to head to the airport and when was preparing all the tips in small envelopes, I realized my money was touched when I had the bigger bills on top of my smaller bills. I did not even want to believe at first, but it’s what it is, it had happened. 
Such a shame that one bad apple, ruined my vacation and left me so disappointed mostly when I know, my personal things have all been abused and touched including my underwear pocket.
The hotel promised they will investigate. Vanessa and James (Security and Guest Relations) were kind and helpful to come to my room at 3am before I packed for the airport and assured me things will be looked at. Until now, I have no feedback and I will be escalating this legally as I had personally called police and demanded for finger prints checking as well. Hoping I can get some feedback as I will feel much better to leave a better feedback for the hotel as if it was not for this experience, I would have had an incredible stay."," Not sure where to start for this review.

The room has not been made up despite us being away from the room from 11am till 5pm and having ""please make up room"" sign. So we didn't have fresh towels for our second night.
The window in the room was extremely dirty when we checked in so we had to clean it ourselves. There was also a coffee glass with clearly visible fingerprints as if it was never washed.
The location is just awful. It's kind of close to the metro but because there are construction everywhere and freeways you can't get there without a taxi.
The check-in clerk offered us a suite upgrade with Burj Khalifa view but the suite was actually a business meeting room (useless to us leisure travelers) attached to a bedroom and the Burj Khalifa was only visible from the meeting room and not from the bedroom. His price offer for the upgrade was also higher than publicly available price at the moment of upgrade and he refused even to match them. When confronted of all the problems we had during the stay on the check out he just said that he's sorry and it's not acceptable in a 5-star hotel; without offering any refund nor even waiving the upgrade fees (I'm used to Radisson Blu in other countries easily offering halving the cost of my stay when I have a minor hiccup and didn't even ask for a refund).

1313,Sweden,Executive Room with Lounge Access,5 nights ,January 2019,Solo traveler," It is a nice hotel with most of the staff doing their best to accommodate your needs.
Overall the hotel was clean, tidy and has a fresh touch to it.
My first impression was very amazing and at first I was happy to have booked this hotel but due to some factors this slowly changed.
I fell sick during my stay: the hotel did their best in arranging a doctor. 
Perhaps if I did not fell ill, I would have enjoyed the hotel differently."," Couple of things: the communication between the room and room service:
Perhaps my misunderstanding but couple of times during my stay I was told that they will get back to me and somehow that part fell between the chairs. When asked about some information, they promised to get back to me but it could take some hours before feedback.
I did not like the fact that bedsheet was not changed during my entire stay, not even once. I stayed more than 5 nights. First two nights I locked myself into the room and I put up the not disturb sign. But afterwards, the room was cleaned 3 times during my stay and not once was the bedsheet changed.
I dont know why but I did not feel the warm welcoming look from some staff members couple of times which made me uneasy.
If arriving at breakfast at 10:45, first thing you heard was the stress tone the person had in their voice as if they wanted everyone to leave at 11:00 sharp. This happened to me when I just went down to get a banana due to the state I was in and then I heard this being said to another person two days later when I was heading out from the breakfast.
The staff members and their facial expressions and tone of their voice can make a large difference and unfortunately some staff members just made me feel very uneasy and very not welcomed.
When I was going to be visited by a male friend of mine: they told me that they will make an exception this once and will let him up to the room due to restrictions...but the same person on the phone could not answer me why my same friend was let up to my room without any problems a day earlier.

She might never stayed in a five star hotel and had experience as a guest (but neither as host too). I pay for my room and its the hotel responsibility to provide a room exactly during the check-in time you state on your hotel policies. In my case, This was not even an early check-in. These apprentices should have been trained to behave and to overcome their daily stress before been put on to the front desk to handle individuals who stay at these exclusive group of hotels which is a 5 Star!!
I was informed by her, that She could not manage to provide a room which I booked for 2 adults and one child which I booked 45 days before arrival.

Staff was helpful and professional and did anything to help us up and down the floors with staff elevator."," Breakfast could be better. When we asked the reseption to help us get a taxi they sent us outside and told us to talk to their «colleagues» but the only thing they did was trying to sell us car rides with private cars that was very expensive, very annoying. Sometimes we had to walk to the car road to get us a taxi. Elevator did not work one of the days. TV did not work good because of the weather. Very expensive food from room service",8.8,Good

And the taxi service of the hotel itself is way more expensive then the local taxi or uber.

Very nice people at reception, we've got the personal tour of facilities and all details. Great job from Adnan.
Exellent job by manager of reservations - we've got upgrade to the junior suite. Very spacy and modern, unfortunately, without any nice view, which was not a problem for us as business travelers.
Good experience with business lounge- very good drinks and good snacks, nice service.
Very good organised airport and Abu Dhabi transfer, great concierge team. Every one is trying to do the best! Thanks a lot!"," The pool area is very nice in the evening, but not as comfy or spacy during the day. Very little pool,it's not possible to swimm, just to stay in the water. So no chance to get fitter by swimming during this stay. The sun chair are new and comfy, just not enough for all the guests. If you plan to stay 1 h at the pool- it's possible, just don't plan longer than that.
The most unpleasent experience we had with simple routine as the breakfest. We came on Sunday by mistake short before closing of buffet ( as they have different time over weekend and different weekend - Friday & Saturday). So the lady at the door did'nt let us in - even still 10 min left. After we said that we're going to the busness lounge instead- she changed her mind and let us in. The food look good, little bit untideness by presentation. But the worse were so many people and not enough service staff. So you have to ask 3 times for capuccino and ""fight"" that someone take care of your omlette.
The breakfets was very stressy and next time we will just not book this option.",9.2,"beautiful panoramic bar with view of Burj Khalifa, great staff, reasonable for Dubai prices"

1439,United Kingdom,,3 nights ,November 2018,Couple," A great hotel overall. New, clean, efficient, great views from terrace and our room. We were upgraded to a suite after our initial room was not what we had booked.
The business room access was WELL worth the extra and most evenings we had this to ourselves whilst waited upon happily by Lorie May - a MOST EXCELLENT member of staff who got it just right. The balance between efficient service, politeness and friendliness. Nothing was too much trouble but she did not over complicate matters or intrude on our personal space.
This was the problem elsewhere when staff did over complicate things, of where systems did this automatically. For example did to changes with flights we required an extra night, this was booked ahead of our visit and I contacted the hotel to explain and try to pre-empt any problems with potentially having to move rooms. At check in they confirmed we would keep the same room no problem. However, we were not told we would need to check out, pay, check in again and even change room key cards which we only discovered on our return to the room which we could no longer access. A minor thing but easily avoided. Not five star when it involves hasstle for the  great hotel overall. New, clean, efficient, great views from terrace and our room. We were upgraded to a suite after our initial room was not what we had booked.

In a very good, serene and easily accessible location, with super-marts, some cafes and restaurants within walking distances.
Overseeing the bay, loved the view from my room. You can walk or cycle by the bay line.
Amenities were also in top shape, probably considering the hotel is still few months old?
Loved the the friendliness of the ENTIRE staff (not a single one to be faulted - from restaurants’ waitresses and waiters, to concierges, to receptionists, housekeeping and especially the porters). All very well mannered and courteous, Just what you should get from every standard hotel, star rating isn’t a consequence.
As there were available rooms, I was also given an early check-in (@7am) without so much as a hassle on the time I arrived. Thanks Radisson for that, I was buzzed out from a really long trip.
Someone mentioned prostitution and all when I was reading reviews, this is very untrue! Even my wife and kids had to be registered when they came to visit me, before they were allowed into my room. Hotel doesn’t allow unregistered guests, Class! Visited the club close to the hotel and got back to my room late, feeling very secured."," The breakfast and A la carte could be better. 
Stayed in the business class room and expected the food in the business lounge to be tastier than it was - for the value paid.
It was worse off in the regular breakfast area.

Good happy hour offers in the bars, great atmosphere in Fire Lake, Makar a little quiet possibly due to its somewhat hidden location on floor P1. Pool was perfect for spending a morning relaxing and unwinding. The view of Burj Khalifa from Fire Lake is something else, particularly in the evening. Room was spotless and modern, great value for money. Location was great, short taxi ride from Burj Khalifa/Dubai Mall. It’s walking distance but DON’T try it.
