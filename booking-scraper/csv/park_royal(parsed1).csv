22,United Kingdom,King Studio,2 nights ,February 2021,Solo traveler," Really like the breakfast, the selection was varied and the portions were great. Would recommend adding breakfast in if you are planning to stay here"," I really disliked the fact that parking is not included with the stay, it has put me off from retuning. The cost is a little steep and Park and Pay do not allow you to select a varied stay amount, so you end up paying the full £12.50 per day, even if you are onside less than 24hours. Please factor this additional cost in if you are planning to stay here
Also, I asked reception to arrange for my bedsheets to be changed and for new towels and returned to my room to find them just left on my bed. Never before have I had to change my own sheets at a hotel",7.0,Pleasant

As you walk into the hotel there was a automatic hand sanitizer machine and the Track & Trace scan before reaching the reception desk. Behind the sanitizer was a trendy bar and seating area with tables, bar stools and mood lighting but it was roped out of use until collecting breakfast which had to collected at a chosen time. Breakfast was hot and cold food served in individual containers in a grab bag but they should have at least provided a plate to eat off instead of out of the separated containers. The reception was to the left on entry and consisted of a desk oppositie the lifts. Check-in staff was friendly but I was taken by surprise when they insisted on photo ID which I don't usually walk with. Luckily I had my work ID with me as I was on-call as a keyworker. There was also another seating area to the left of the reception desk that seemed part of a café area with tall backed arm chairs and coffee tables. Next to the lift was 2 tall fridges holding alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages and chocolates plus another tall cupboard of snacks and freezer with ice-cream below a travel essentials cupboard all for sell and purchasing at reception.There was signs for the fitness centre but I didn't visit it due to the COVID restrictions.
The carpeted corridors leading to the bedrooms had strip lighing lining each wall between the doors giving it a trendy look. The bedroom was very modern with digital panels to set the lighting in room & bathroom and also set the heating, air conditioning and mood lighting. There was a lovely blue & aqua neon lighting within one side of a patterned wide and full length mirror.The king size bed had a single shelf either side of the bed with a large bed settee next to one of the bedside shelves. Opposite the bed was a long desk with a fridge as one of the drawers and a glass coffee table between the bed settee and d", Had to pay £12.50 via a phone App for the car park although there is a telephone number to call too,8.0,Pleasant stay in a big trendy room

It’s dark and cosy which is perfect for the winter. 
The staff are so polite and helpful. 
The room is cleaned to perfection."," My husband slept like an angel... I on the other hand DID NOT. Being 7months pregnant and trying to relax on such a hard bed is not ideal. The pillows aren’t fluffy either so all I could think about was my pregnancy pillow back home😭.
The LED light can be extremely annoying to the eye after you’ve had your 20minutes fun with it. 
There’s no way of you dimming the room without the LED light being on so we had to turn off all lights and keep the dark mode light on in the bathroom to achieve what we wanted. 
And lastly the door to the toilet is shared with the shower, the toilet door doesn’t go as far as the shower would when getting dragged across so my husband heard me fart multiple times🙃.",8.8,SO!

136,United Kingdom,Superior King Room,1 night ,October 2020,Couple," We have stayed at this hotel many times before and have always been happy with every aspect of our stay. I was a little anxious being away from home due to the current situation but I needn’t have worried. For me, they went above and beyond when it came to making sure we would feel safe during our stay.  
From the hand sanitiser and QR code as soon as you walk in, a camera to take your temperature, protective screens at reception, the pots for used pens and used key cards so there could be no cross contamination. Then there were the little touches in the room where there strips around the toilet and the wardrobe to show that it had been sanitised, the toilet rolls had packaging around on it so again you knew it hadn’t be used by the previous occupant. Yes there were paper cups and wood stirrers to use instead of the usual mugs and spoons but that wasn’t an issue for me. We even had the option to use a QR code to allow me to use my mobile phone as the tv remote control, which was really easy to set up and for those who didn’t want to do this, the remote control was kept clean and safe in a protective bag.  
Even when we had a takeaway delivered to the hotel, which we often do during our stays, the hotel provided takeaway boxes and plastic cutlery for us to use. The hotel was only open to residents only after 18:30 and wristbands were provided to ensure this was managed properly. 
To me they seem to have thought of everything and more to help keep their customers and also their staff as safe as possible.",,10,Covid Stay

264,United Kingdom,Studio Twin,2 nights ,August 2020,Family, Very comfortable bed.  I love the fact that each floor has an ice machine that you can use for your beverages especially with the heat waves we had in London hitting 36 degrees celsius.  Underground stations nearby are: Park Royal and 10 mins walk you have Hanger Lane station.," The TV remote control of one of the two rooms I booked (room 514) was not working properly; I couldn't operate the TV from the bed and had to be half a metre close to the TV.  It's a shame that their TV service does not provide Youtube or Netflix access without screencasting your mobile, which was unresponsive for my mobile - Samsung Android.  Also, movies are on paid service, which is a bit of a letdown.  Hanger Lane underground station is better to use when planning for your journey itinerary; but, unfortunately, it is a 10-min walk.  The Park Royal station is across the road but it is not suggested by Google Map when planning your journey - going out to attractions and central London.
Toilet/shower design is a bit odd especially if two friends; not a couple, are staying in the same room - the sliding door gives no privacy if one wants to use toilet and the other roommate wants the shower at the same time.",8.0,Clean and comfortable

Stated that rooms were 'soundproof' but you could clearly hear doors slamming and people talking loudly in corridors.
Car park was an absolute joke! Not enough spaces nor structure. You give your parking space number when you check-in, pay for a space. If you decide to go out for the day and another driver parks in your paid space, staff will happily give your space away to other customers and expect them to pay also. By the time you return there are NO spaces, you are advised to park in Travelodge's car park next door which is owned by a car park service APCOA. Failure to pay that fee could result in a £100 fine.

As we had already paid for parking and have a disabled badge, my husband moved one so that we could park up. Almost immediately a member of staff wearing a high vis jacket came out because we had moved the cone and asked whether we had a disabled badge which we had already displayed in the car. The reason I have an issue with this is because the 5 cars in the row opposite were also parked in disabled bays yet none of those were displaying a disabled badge and neither did the 2 cars parked along side us when we left this morning. 
Almost every time we stay the disabled bays closest to the doors are coned off yet at various stages these cones are moved to allow some expensive cars to park there, again none of these have disabled badges. 
As reservations are not allowed I’m not sure why this happens but its clear there are exceptions to this rule.

- breakfast was really good, especially the orderable omelletes
- nice and modern hotel
- located really near the metro station
- very good value for the price
- possible to go to the city center directly by the piccadilly line (35 minutes)"," - there was no real door for the bathroom + toilet. Just a small sliding door for eather the toilet or the shower. So you could really just choose one at a time. The bathroom part as a whole was anyways a no door design. So if for example the toilet is used and the shower afterwards, the door has to be slided to the shower side and all the (if there is) smell goes to the whole room. This is really not acceptablte, at all. Every normal bathroom has just a door. A pity, since the hotel is otherwise a big recommendation!",9.6,Exceptional

575,United Arab Emirates,Superior King Room,2 nights ,November 2019,Couple," Parking is a bit of a pain, 12.50 and the machine only takes coins or register to use an app that you can’t register to use unless you have an English mobile number.

Great views of the city of London from room 338. The toilet / shower room is nice but has no door offering no privacy which wouldn’t be to everyone’s taste.  
We had a meal in the restaurant on Saturday night which was good."," Car parking was a bit of an issue. There are limited spaces and we were told not to park in a specific spot because our car (Range Rover) was considered too big for it. There was no issue and we parked  with plenty of space and we proceeded to park there & pay £12.50 for 24 hrs.
The bathroom situation is bizarre - there’s no door offering no privacy when using the bathroom. I have Crohn’s Disease and I like privacy when using the toilet. 
The breakfast this morning wasn’t good - there was a bit of a wait to be seated. The hot chocolate inside the thermos flask was cold, there were no baked beans and when we asked for some it took a very long time for them to be brought out (by which time we’d already started and finished our food). Despite asking for some ketchup (because the two bottles out were empty) it never made an appearance.

The rooms were lovely with some funky mod cons and a really good breakfast. A lovely view over the city from the room as well. It was in a good location just over the road from the tube station, really easy to get around. The staff put some complimentary chocolate cake in our room to celebrate a special occasion which was a nice touch."," We felt judged when we walked in as we are quite a young couple, like we didn't fit in with the business men or more affluent clientele, however, when they asked if we had stayed in and Park Plaza's before and we explained we had and which ones, their attitude soon changed. But still, it shouldn't be like that. The rooms are nice but the bathroom had a sliding door which covered the shower or the toilet, not both and it wouldn't ever close completely which was slightly frustrating. Also our TV didn't work in the room.",7.9,"Really lovely, but I've stayed in better Park Plaza Hotels."

The bar was open till late.
The reception area is a great space to chill out.
The room I had was clean and spacious."," On arrival I was not happy that the staff said my card would be charged on checkout. They asked for my card, took a pre-authorisation and I suddenly receive a message they have debited £150 more without asking me whilst I am standing there. 
That equates to 50% of my overall stay for the 3 nights, or an extra £50 per night. How is that even acceptable? On checkout they said that any balance would be returned back but it takes 3-5 days. 
I do wish the hotel had free parking. They charge £12.50 for parking for 24 hours.
The location is on the motorway. Whilst you don't hear the noise, it's not the most pleasant of views.  
I wanted to have the breakfast buffet but it didn't look that appetising for vegetarians for the amount it cost.",8.3,Very Good

You can pay by the machine on site that only accept coin and not credit card. Another way is through the app. As I came from France, my mobile no is not local,so I couldn’t use the app. I wrote to the company and raised my concerns, but there is no response. This nearly spoiled my mood because I have to park my car for two days. I have to renew my parking for the next 24 hours because you only can pay for 24 hours and not 48hours at one go. That is an restriction for me going to town and worries that my parking will be expired. I hope the hotel management can raise the concerns to the parking company.",9.2,Wonderful

On arrival we were told that the hotel did not have minibars in the room and were given one voucher each for a drink. There was then some confusion about what drink we could have and 10 minutes later we were served some drinks. 
Once we got to our upgraded room, it was far from the suite we were promised and a dread to think how small the normal rooms were. Later that evening we returned to the hotel and wanted a drink, however there were no bar staff, unfortunately we had to ask 3 times at reception and wait 25 minutes for a drink. 
Finally when asking if we could order a taxi to Chiswick in the evening, at reception we were asked 'have you got a phone'. This was appalling and we had to find our own way to leave the hotel.",7.1,Overall the hotel is lovely but the staff were not great.

In particular, one lady seemed determined to ignore the people who had been waiting for service to attend to a new group of people who had just come in. This was not helped by the manager, who came out, saw that there were a lot of people waiting for service, but instead just fiddled with the till rather than resolve the issues.

From the very beginning I was a bit disappointed by the location of this hotel because it is at 3rd district in London (according to London Tube map) so it takes more time to visit city center. However, we soon got used to this distance and became comfortable because of the easy access to the tube itself. The hotel is so close to the tube station that the distance does not bother any more.
It was also disappointing when I entered into the room after check-in due to bad smell. I even wanted to quit staying here. The staff accepted my complain about the smell and tried to change the room for me. One day after I got to learn that the smell comes from the chemical cleaning stuff. The hotel has indeed a ""Go Green"" plan, for which you may even get 10 pound discount if you skip the room service per night. In order to avoid that smell, I've chosen the Go Green option. The towels got updated still every day, which is pretty enough for us.
The bed is comfortable here. Space is enough to turn around. TV is also a good set. So in overall, it's a comfortable stay in this hotel with a rather reasonble price compared to the price in central London.
On the day for an early check-out, hotel has also prepared breakfast-takeway for us. This is also nice.
Overall, we are satisfied and comfortable staying here."," As mentioned above, I don't like the detergent which this hotel has used. It smells so bad and more beyond... After one and half hour staying in the room after check-in, I got rather sick. Luckily there is a spare room for exchange. But still, I  was not well for that whole night and next day.",9.6,Comfortable for a long stay

Lovely Elemis products in the bathroom went down very well."," Sadly the breakfast was pretty poor, the hotel was understandably busy as alot of people stayed there after the England V Czech Rep match at Wembley. 
The spread of food available was well below standard. We had two children with us who just wanted the basics, for the duration of time we were sat in the restaurant there was intermittent replenishment of cereals, juices, bread and no sign of any pastries and hot cooked food. No mugs, glasses, bowls or plates and no butter and condiments.
When asking the staff whether they would be replenishing they said that they were busy - this is a large hotel and it just seemed that the process of replenishment and keeping an eye on things was left as less of a priority. 
Instead they were bringing more people into the restaurant, who also were adding to the list of disgruntled customers. 
On check out the staff were very apologetic, and I did receive a credit as we barely consumed anything other then a few pieces of toast. 
It really is such a shame as the hotel is really ever so nice, and perfectly placed for access to London - maybe better management of this would help, and instead of accepting more customers why not be upfront and ask customers to wait to enter whilst the chefs and waiting staff ensure items are refilled.",8.3,As above

Underground right across the road which connects directly to central London via Piccadilly line. There’s another station 10 min by walk served by central line. So it literally takes 30-35 minutes to get to Oxford circus. The staff are cordial and helpful. I was particularly impressed with the gentleman in charge of night security. He helped us locate our cab in wee hours of the morning and also carried our luggage. So kind of him. Unfortunately, don’t know his name."," Our bathroom floor had stains of shoes which didn’t look neat. Also, the concept of no doors for the bathrooms is quite odd. One needs privacy particularly if traveling with friends/ family. 
Our beds were not done well even though we left a clean my room note everyday. I understand the concept of environmental conservation. So it’s ok if bed linen is not changed daily but the hotel staff should be trained well to tidy up the beds.",8.8,Excellent

We went back down to reception again to get it to work. Went back up to the room, again, it didn't work. Had to trapse down to reception again to say it wasn't working, still. I was waiting, sat on the hotel corridor floor with all our bags. Whilst my husband was working with reception to get us into our room. 
Eventually we were told we had to wait for the hotel engineer to come and replace the batteries in the key card swipe pad. This was what was causing the problem. I wouldn't mind but we did check in around 10am & didnt come back to the hotel until 5pm so the hotel had all day to fix this error. As a result we were late for our evenings plans (our main reason for the trip) as didn't have enough time to get ready as we were locked out of our room.

Breakfast items such as scrambled egg and hash browns were not being replenished thus meaning a long line of guests were having to wait.

Getting into the city was simple."," I can honestly say that the room was to a good standard, the bed was very comfortable & met the expectations. However I did expect the level of the cleanliness to be of a higher standard, the duvet had many stains on it & this left my girlfriend feeling very uncomfortable! The stains were brownish/red. It looked like blood or something else, it made us feel like we were in a cheap bed & breakfast. In the night when we went to bed went wanted to use it but my girlfriend refused to have that on the bed & I had to agree with her. Also the counter surface where the kettle & cups were was very dirty & dusty, it was clear to see that this hadn’t been dusted or cleaned properly. It made us not even want to drink waterproof use the cups. 
We often take time for a little get away from the family, just for a night or 2. It’s mainly just for some piece & quiet but my partner wasn’t too impressed. 
I did sleep well & I hope that if we ever stay there again it’s better next time.

1853,Denmark,Superior King Room,7 nights ,August 2018,Couple," My boyfriend and I both enjoyed the stay at Park Plaza. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the TV (and the sky channels!), as well as the air conditioning (which was much appreciated in this heat). The mood lighting was also a nice touch, and the room was a nice size. The bed was very big and fine to sleep on, much better than what we have experienced elsewhere in London but still far from the best nights sleep you have ever had. The location was also very convenient, and it was easy to use the tube. Even though the hotel was right next to a busy motorway the room was extremely quiet, and I felt like each room was very well isolated which was a huge plus!"," We tried ordering room service on our third or fourth evening but we were unable to do so because of understaffing (that's all we were told). That was very disappointing because ASDA was a twenty minute walk away and it was raining heavily. We had decided on our way home to just order room service that night rather than bring something with us, so we ended up going to bed hungry. Then on our fifth day we ordered some room service for lunch, and the food was extremely disappointing, very poor quality, we waited an hour to receive it. We ordered a pizza, mac and cheese and a hamburger which all together totalled 43 pounds. The pizza was very bland, tasted like a very cheap frozen pizza. I usually like frozen pizzas, but this pizza was so bad that I barely finished half of it. They forgot to make the mac and cheese as well as bring ketchup and mayo for the hamburger, so we waited an extra 35 minutes for that to arrive, although by that time, the hamburger had already been eaten.. The hamburger looked nice but was also incredibly mediocre. The mac and cheese was fine, but felt like a canteen version of it, definitely not worth four pounds. I also think there should be two free bottles of water that are replenished each day (this is the first time I have not had access to unlimited water at a four star hotel). 
One morning we were awoken incredibly abruptly to the fire alarm, which went off extremely loudly for a full minute or two. It was extremely startling and we immediately called the reception, who couldn't answer any questions but said that someone would come up to our room and explain what had happened. No one ever came to our room as the receptionist had promised or even called us back, which we thought was a little strange. The fire alarm also went off again during the middle of the day but for less time on a different day. That wasn't a big deal to us.",7.5,"Very modern, safe and comfortable."

1947,Croatia,Superior King Room,2 nights ,August 2020,Couple, Madrass was not bad and cleaning ladies were nice.," Definately the worst Radisson or by Radisson ever. Breakfast was take away, yet there was nowhere any kind of information about this situation (not even on the hotel web page). Had I known this, I would not book breakfast with accommodation. The reception did not convey our choice of breakfast (there were only two choices) to the restaurant/kitchen. Finally, when the ""breakfast"" was ready, half of the things that were supposed to be in the bag were missing (butter, compote for porridge, sugar, cuttlery - no proper spoons). We paid for the proper breakfast, and did not get even that mediocre take-away that we had to eat in our room which was definately not designed for this. We notified reception about this, received assurances that this would not happen the next day and that we will have ""a perfect"" breakfast tommorrow. Given that breakfast has a Danish roll, a bun with bacon or egg and spinach (one can't have both) it is not really a buffet breakfast we paid for. But even the next day, and although we stated the time when wanted the breakfast, we had to wait for it, and ultimately we were late for a meeting. Not  to mention that they managed to run out of the paper bags!!!
Bathroom/lavatory is to say the least weird, with sliding doors - meaning if one is in the shower with closed doors, then the other one can not use the toillet and the other way around. And because of the poor design, when having a shower, water, instead going down the drain, actually spills over into the rest of the bathroom.",3.0,NEVER AGAIN!

We had booked it for one day at booking.com however we wanted to extend our stay for another night but the brunette girl at the reception misunderstood.

No response after a week, emailed the hotel through the website commenting on our stay and asking for a response.  Two weeks passed no response at all.

One of our rooms was missing a door to the toilet and shower, not reasonable to give anyone a 'broken' room... Furthermore to that, in relocating rooms one of our crew left some items in that room which were never found (PJs left under pillow) ... Either the cleaners didn't go in and refresh the room, or they were thrown. Disappointing.

Reception were very friendly as were all the staff I encountered, especially in the restaurant. They held their team meeting in the restaurant which some people would find annoying but I actually think it showed potential and ambition.

Curtains were blackout which I actually really appreciated. 
Nice spacious rooms.
Though the location is a fair distance from the centre, it's close to wembley by taxi or uber and there are enough restaurants and a cinema nearby to entertain/feed you for a night or two if you're not able to travel too far nightly/daily.

Went for a drink in the bar, one of the bar staff smashed a wine glass, some went down my top and into my hair, no acknowledgement from the guy that it had even happened. Even as I was fishing glass from my hair, and off the bar to pass back to him, he was completely oblivious.
Told the receptionist as we checked out about the toilet seat issue, hopefully it has been resolved so nobody else has to experience it.",4.6,Disappointing
2093,United Kingdom,King Studio (3 Adults),1 night ,June 2019,Family, The rooms were clean," Customer service was appalling. Room  and confirmed day before by phone and again at front desk was only set up for 2 people not 3. When we went the front desk they curtly told us there was a sofa bed, but we pointed out not only was it not made up but there wasn't even any bedding to make it up. There was 24 hour but when my daughter requested a cold tuna sandwich at midnight she was told she would have to wait an hour and a half. She explained she needed it to take her medication and was told we're busy it's an hour and a half. So I had to buy crisps from the bar just so she could take her meds.  
Trying to get ready for bed we found that there was no cold water from any of the bathroom taps just hot water, which was very unpleasant try to clean your teeth with.  
The next morning we queued up to enter the breakfast room and when we got to the front of the queue we were told we because there was 3 of us we had 3 options... we could eat at separate tables....eat at the low coffee tables in the bar or stand aside and let 5 or 6 couples behind through and when the queue had gone down they might find us a table.... the queue was constantly growing. We ended up eating in the bar.  Then they ran out of beans , bread for toast, glasses for juice and all croissants and pastries.  Never ever would I recommend this hotel.",3.8,Appalling service.

Nice evening meal menu which was reasonably priced.," We found what appeared to be a flea in our bed, the management were helpful in dealing with this and thoroughly cleaned our room, but we were shocked considering the cost and star rating of the hotel, we were provided with a discount on check out which we appreciated, but unfortunately this did spoil our trip.

2099,United Kingdom,Superior King Room,1 night ,June 2019,Couple," The rooms were large and the bathroom was adequate. The location was great as was adjacent to the tube station so we were able to get to Wembly with ease. 
Ricciardo who we checked in and out with was excellent."," Unfortunately the bar staff were obviously new and inexperienced so when they were descended upon when lots of guests returned after the concert they didn’t cope very well. The bar ran out of various drinks, which I found unusual for a big hotel!
The room service menu seemed good and as we were hungry when we got back decided to order from it. The phone call to room service went unanswered as did reception. In the end I popped back down to order from the menu. However was told that as it was so busy only the margarita pizza and ham toastie was available!  As hungry I ordered one of each and was told that it would be about half an hour - this was at midnight. We eventually got our order at quarter to two! The pizza was okay but the toastie was very underwhelming- uncooked bread you couldn’t call it toast a thin piece of ham with a bit of cheese. 
Ricciardo did try and make amends when we checked out but it definitely soured our stay.",6.7,Good location

Arriving back later and wanting food only to discover there was nothing, this was also annoying, we asked for sandwiches to be sent up which was reluctantly done, when asked if we could buy a packet of crisp, which we could clearly see from the bar, we were told they were not for sale? It took an hour to make a sandwich, when it finally arrived the bread was stale and cheap white bread, I paid £209 for one night, I have had better experience in a pud guest house costing only £70 with food on hand and no extra cost for breakfast, very disappointed",6.0,Pleasant

And you couldn't turn of the mood lighting embedded in the mirror without all the lights goind out. The room also smelled like weed/pot the air cleaner i asked for never made it to the room.

2125,United Kingdom,Studio Twin (3 Adults),2 nights ,June 2019,Family, Great location!," Unfortunately my stay at this hotel seems less positive than the reviews I read before booking. Maybe this was due to the weekend I was there...and perhaps the biggest issue is that the staff are not trained to handle ‘busy’ weekends (influx of people due to BTS concert at Wembley Stadium).
So there were a number of issues! First off, we arrived late Friday night (11pm) - tired and just wanting to go to bed! The foyer was busy and staff looked ‘frazzled’ to say the least! No smiling welcome that I am used to at hotel reception. They had run out of key cards so security were having to escort people up to their rooms (security being all of 1 person)! We were one of the fortunate ones to get a key card - but just one...which was a right pain when my daughter and I needed to separate! Second issue - I was trapped outside the front door  - late at night on my own and felt very, very vulnerable! The automatic door is
broken from the outside so requires someone from the inside to open...which is highly problematic when your only security guard is running up and down lifts to let people into their rooms...it was a disaster! They seemed to know about the door issue but didn’t seem to be doing anything to rectify or even apologize. Staff were also completely uncommunicative - we stood waiting to be checked in for ages while the gentleman at reception stood staring at his computer...only when after much awkward silence, not knowing what was going on I asked him ‘so are you checking us in’ did he respond that he was having a system issue! Lastly - staff at the bar were unprofessional! I ordered a drink to take up to my room and handed over cash - manager of the bar then reprimands the bar lady right in front of me; saying ‘we don’t take cash after 11pm’...the poor woman looked dejected and I felt extremely awkward...that’s not the way it’s done sir!
Honestly - this was probably one of my worst hotel experiences (and I’ve stayed in many hotels)!",5.8,Can’t handle a busy weekend!! Do not recommend.
2126,United Kingdom,Superior King Room,3 nights ,May 2019,Couple, The hotel is located very close to the station and have great channels (Sky channels ) for free!," I had been bitten all over my arms , wrists , legs , stomach on the very first night! Manager came next morning in my room and he confirmed I was bitten and filled out a bed bugs form. You cannot open the window so there’s no way anything else bite me other than mosquitos and bed bugs.
 After this the hotel DIDN’T care even though I have addressed this privately ( on 6th May)  but the hotel chose to ignore me completely for past couple of weeks. So this had to be addressed publicly. 
The hotel staff don’t really care even thought I had been required medical attention for the bites (Which left me marks all over) and was in agony for the remaining nights of my stay till now on this day! Itching in bed. Our room was changed but I didn’t receive anything from the hotel even an apology which is absolutely disgusting. I’ll never stay here again!",5.4,AVOID**

We were offered free breakfast as a kind gesture by the hotel staff but to be honest if I had paid for what I had in the morning(£15!!!! Each) I would have went mad.

I had to report these issues twice and the next day they were still an issue even though they did finally send someone. The staff is really poorly trained and several times i was in the bar and no one was there or at the front desk when no one was there.

Fine if you are in a one room one person occupancy not quite so fine when there are two of you and you need a little bathroom privacy.

two bottles of water everyday"," If you are visiting London for couple of days, you don't have kids and find this hotel as bargain then my review won't be useful for you, otherwise here some tips you might like to read before you make a reservation.
We've spent about two weeks in this hotel with our 3 year old kid and will share our experience.
It started when I went downstairs to the restaurant with a kid to ask to warm up chocolate for him. Tomas ,guy who work there, simply refused, he told me a lot about their ""high standards""""food hygiene """"how good they are"" but they still can't warm up a chocolate:)...
Location is good if you've got a car and don't have to go to central London, otherwise you'll spent at least 10 minutes waiting for the train in the tube and then 30-40 minutes to get to central London(believe me Piccadilly line is not quick).Hotel is about 5 minutes away from the station, but does it really helps?No
Every night they close the door after 11 P.M. But the door bell didn't work :) Funny? Not at all.It was cold and when I eventually got inside they told me ""sorry about that"" :) ""high standards""! hey didn't fix the bell until we moved out but someone was sitting there to opened the door:) High standards ?:))
From high standards point of view  the last place you you'd probably think of is under the bed, but believe me it'd be very useful to clean it there from time to time
Shower..looks good, but after you've had it the floor becomes wet in the whole bathroom and toilet, then you have to dry it:)....high standards...
Big companies likes an employees ""robot-like"" Tomas who will do everything he can to curry favor for their bosses. Simple greediness could be covered by beautiful words.",2.9,Very Poor

So in other words you got the wrong room number and woke the wrong people ruining the stay for us as we didn’t get a proper full nights sleep! And all they could say was sorry about that! Also didn’t use the shower as it was filthy and obviously hadn’t been cleaned before we arrived!

There is also a retail park literally 2 mins drive down the road where you can find restaurants etc. The car park generally has good amount of parking - the cost is £10 a day.", The customer service could be a bit better.

I went to reception to ask if perhaps I wasn't seeing a handle or button. The receptionist sent someone to our room to help. When the guy arrived, I pointed out that there was a rail in the ceiling which would make you think at some point there must have been a door, but after looking he informed me that there was no door in this room and left. At no point were we offered any kind of recompense for this inconvenience or an option to change rooms. 
I have stayed in hostels in remote areas of the world where the bathroom facilities consisted of a hole in the ground but even those had doors to give you some privacy. It was so uncomfortable! The last thing you want when you're relaxing in bed is to hear / smell your partner going to the toilet.

The parking application/ phone number was not working during our stay. The parking is absolutely attrocious. As someone who required disabled parking half the parking are disabled spots and not one person was displaying a blue badge. The lift and corridors smelt of weed and music was being blasted throughout the hotel from different occupiers until 4am. Hotel staff did not do anything about any of these concerns. The answer we got is yes we know it happens all the time which is a joke. The hotel is more like a brothel on weekends and the staff admitted this in person.
