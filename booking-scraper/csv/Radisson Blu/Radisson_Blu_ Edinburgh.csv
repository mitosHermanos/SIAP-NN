The staff brought my partner water and eventually we were able to head up to our room after the drama.

242,Chile,Premium Room,4 nights ,March 2020,Group," The hotel is well situated, on High Street, near the railway station, close to the Edinburgh castle and Princes Street, so it’s easy to walk from there almost anywhere you want to visit.
The breakfast was good, lots to choose from at the buffet.
The beds were amazing, after walking all day it was easy to relax and just drift off into sleep."," We had an issue with the staff one night, my friends were having a gathering downstairs because some of them smoke, they were not disruptive or making a mess, but a person on the staff saw them drinking some whiskey, we were after all buying whiskey that day and they were trying some out, and this person took the bottle from them, without reason, and the explanation was ridiculous, like we don’t allow drinking here? I guess they don’t allow it if you don’t buy it at their bar or something, because the glasses and ice they were using were from the hotel bar, they asked for them. Anyway, later one they ask for our property back, the bottle, because it was ours, but I wouldn’t have let them take it on the first place, if you don’t want your passengers drinking on your premises ask them to move it to the room or leave the space, but don’t touch what’s not your property.
Two nights later or so we actually went to the hotel bar, charge what we had to our room, left, were just getting settled when they called us because they couldn’t find our credit card on the system or something, we had to get back down and tried to sort it out, but the truth is we never understood what was wrong with the card they had entered when we checked in; they even asked if I wanted to put that charge on another credit card, which I said of course not, they had a credit card on their system and that was the card they should use for the charge. After not learning what went wrong, or what they actually wanted, we finally went to bed. This whole thing could have been resolved the next morning, but no, we had to try and resolve it right then and there.",10,Great hotel

On check in we were not told about any facilities at the hotel we could use or where breakfast would be served and times for this. We were told to come back at 12.30/1pm to check in and when we arrived back to check in at 2.15pm we were told the room still was not ready for another 20 minutes which was unfortunate as our baby needed to settle with warm milk and a nap.",8.0,Really lovely stay just a few things could have been improved

I have stayed in a lot of hotels and this was one of the best EVER, staff were very friendly and welcoming and could not help enough. We arrived early and they took the luggage from us and when the room was ready took our luggage up, all while we explored Edinburgh without dragging our baggage with us. Bed was very comfortable and the room was spotless. Did not come across a single member of staff who was not smiling and courteous. An absolute credit to your company. We will be back and would definitely recommend it most highly 👍👍👍", A serve yourself coffee machine would be brilliant as the coffee is served in flasks which can get tepid quickly.....and I’m being picky now as I’m a coffee nut in the morning.

620,United Kingdom,Premium Room,3 nights ,November 2019,Couple, The young concierge who retreived our bags was very helpful.," Reception staff at check-in refused to check my wife in when she arrived at the hotel without me, even though she knew the details of our stay. They were unnecessarily brusque.
This was only resolved by phoning the venue of the conference I was speaking at and asking me for the credit card details of the booking.
This problem was compounded by the manager coming to the room, admitting the receptionist had been brusque and defending their policy. A simple apology would have helped. 
I have never had this at other hotels where we have arrived separately - not an unusual occurence. 
Most decent hotels whose staff have misjudged a situation apologise and make some small gesture of goodwill - Radisson Blu could learn some lessons from them.
The result was we ate elsewhere and spent no more money at the Radisson.
When asked how was your stay on checking out we were subjected to further rounds of defence of their policy with no recognition of the embarrassment and stress caused to my wife.",7.9,Good

625,Ireland,Superior Room,2 nights ,November 2019,Couple, breakfast was generally good with a mixture of buffet and cooked to order food. However on the first day we were not asked if we wanted anything from the cooked to order menu and assumed this was all part of the buffet. On second day we were asked and the cooked items we ordered were very good," on check in the receptionist immediately pushed the upgrade option to a junior suite. when asked what was the advantage  we were told it would be a nicer room with a better view. As we had already booked a superior room we declined. we thought the whole process could have been handled better. e.g the receptionist could have begun by saying "" we do have a special offer today ………...etc""
When we reached the our room
1)  it was extremely cold as the thermostat was set to 17. however we were able to adjust this and after about half an hour the room warmed up.  
2) the  joins on the hessian type wallpaper were beginning to come away in about 4 separate places,
3) there was a lot of accumulated dust on the skirting board below the window.
4) when we put the room card for the lights into its holder on the wall the front casing fell off,
We mentioned all of these points to a lady who was cleaning the next door room and she said she would make sure all of these points would be corrected, We then went out for a quick snack and when we returned after about an hour all of the above points had been dealt with.",8.0,Overall we enjoyed our stay and particular thanks to the 2 concierges who were both very helpful
626,United Arab Emirates,Superior Room,2 nights ,November 2019,Family," In my opinion Old Town is the best place to stay in Edinburgh and therefore location of the hotel is great as it is in the center of old town.

Tried to charge me £290 a room not the £232 on the booking.   Good job I had the booking on the booking.com app as proof.
I booked breakfast but when we went to breakfast was told that we were not on the list for breakfast and they had to “find” a table.

He left his desk to show me possible rooms that I could move into.  Within 30 mins we had a new room with phone and aircon.  To no fault of his, unfortunately, this room was also flawed as when I checked the bathroom sink, it was full of mud.  Housekeeping had not done their job.  When I let Joaquin know, he offered and insisted that he come and clean the sink for us.  Since I had a long travelling day I declined his very kind offer and let housekeeping handle it the next day.  If it weren’t for Joaquin, I would have rated this hotel pretty poorly.

No she was actually downright rude and almost cost this hotel a good review. Don’t put rude people on your desks. There are a few of them at this hotel. The desk people are your ambassadors.

The pool was good and I loved the bed as it was really comfortable and cosy, I was a little disappointed with breakfast although the variety and choice was good the quality of the cooked food was not the best as the bacon was very fatty and the hash browns were very dry and tasteless. The customer service was also very abrupt and not very friendly in the breakfast area no smiles friendly conversation or anything I felt a little uncomfortable and the man gave off the vibe he was too flustered and a bit annoyed which was a shame as it was my birthday and my last morning in Edinburgh (which is my faveourite city) before heading home.,7.9,Short but sweet good location and room only let down by Brekafast

899,Australia,Superior Room,1 night ,June 2019,Couple," Unbeatable location in the Old Town on the Royal Mile, in an attractive, architecturally sympathetic building that was only built in 1993, though you wouldn't know it. There is a degree of the impersonal about this hotel though it was very comfortable and modern. We did not visit the bar or restaurant on site and so cannot comment. It was easy to leave our bags at the desk after check-out as we had a late flight, and we were also able to access the hotel spa for a last minute shower before heading to the airport for our long flight, although we did not take advantage of that in the end."," I would have liked more personal service, but I think with the volume of guests coming through such an iconic location, you cannot avoid a degree of impersonality--service was always friendly and professional, but ultimately disinterested, which is fair enough for a big city. The porter took our bags to the cab rank after we checked out, and expected a tip, which we were not prepared for (coming from a society that rarely tips for service). We felt slightly embarrassed by this, as we have not experienced any such expectation travelling throughout Scotland for over three weeks.",8.8,"Unbeatable location in the Old Town, charming hotel, a bit impersonal, but overall very good."

The next day I had the same thing and my friend had to try and order an omelette three times and it still never turned up. Other tables who came in after us got their breakfast orders. 
I don’t think it’s fair to colour the reputation of the hotel based on this one aspect, the staff overall were brilliant and the breakfast buffet items were great but the service at breakfast was the only issue I had. The restaurant as a whole, the food when we did get it was excellent.

The car park was accessible by a lift straight in to the hotel so no pulling suitcases up the cobbled streets.", The superior room was in what felt like attic conversion with low ceilings and a tiny window. I know it’s a traditional property but I’d say the room we were in was more of what I’d expect in a standard room in a hotel of this quality. There was a pillow menu left on the bed which would have been ideal if there had been any alternative pillows available. When calling reception to request an anti allergy one we were told there were none. Not ideal when all the pillows in the room  are soft feather ones. What might be “luxury” for some isn’t for others.,8.3,Very Good

The cold food selection of meats and cheese was really nice but the ""hot"" buffet food left a lot to be desired. The lids were broke on some of the containers, meaning the food was dried out. The eggs were cold, and overall wasn't a great experience. Shame as everything else was fantastic.....",9.2,A lovely night away in a great location.

Late night staff were very obliging when my friends and I arrived back and sat up late asking for drinks, food etc.  I used the gym which was good for a general workout."," Bed too soft/ had a quilt on the mattress plus noise from the street at 3/4am meant I got very little sleep on the first night.

Our one-night stay was near perfect."," Our one-night stay was near-perfect, EXCEPT for one specific thing:  The caustic, cheap-smelling air freshener used to ""neutralize"" smells in the rooms (and, I found, elsewhere on the property, such as public toilets).  This wasn't a ""signature scent"" of the brand -- it's something commonly used to neutralize rooms and, in my case, brought on near-allergic reactions.  I remember the same scent being used in Aloft Hotels and in the Penguin, a cheap motel in South Beach.  But I digress.  The first room my business partner was assigned had that scent, and she couldn't be in it for more than a minute.  We asked for another room, which the hotel quickly gave us.  Thanks!  My point in all this -- there must be something else that can be used as this freshener, as it instantly brought ""cheap hotel"" to mind for me.  And this property is not a cheap hotel in any way, except for that scent.  Thanks for the opportunity to comment!

Similarly, when we needed a last minute dinner booking for Saturday night, concierge was able to recommend a very good restaurant and arrange a table for us. Thank you Kenneth!
The suite was gigantic with a separate lounge room and dining area. Bedroom was large also. Only point I'd make is they could have cut down on space in the hallway or lounge room to make the bathroom bigger - bit of a squeeze for two people simultaneously. Bed was very comfortable and linen nice and cosy for cold nights in Edinburgh!

Honeymoon weekend having just got married during Covid crisis. You would think cleanliness would be a priority. Booked a superior room. Was told it had been cleaned and was ready. Checked in and went to room. Having a look around as you do. Someone’s old dirty top was on the floor behind one of the chairs! Obviously not a thorough clean! I hat else hadn’t they checked or cleaned! Complained and moved rooms. Next day went out and again room was supposedly cleaned while we were out. However they had failed to change the pillowcases because it was still covered in make up from the night before! If they hadn’t changed those this meant they hadn’t changed the sheets at all as the pillow was on top. I go home also means they probably hadn’t cleaned the room again. The rooms are not cheap and this is supposed to be a quality hotel but housekeeping t had let you down twice. How can anyone be sure they are safe in your hotel In Times or Covid. I have emailed the company twice and had no response. Once while still there!! Very disappointed and put a dampener on the oi mi I honeymoon. It had been a stressful enough week with getting married and cancelled reception meaning hardly any family due to Covid. We did not have the luxury of postponing. We treated our selves to this break in o give us a good start to married life.

The “Premier”room was very tired and in need of a revamp. They are charging 4 & 5 star prices for a 3 star room. We also went to the bar before heading out for the night. We were told to have a seat by the barman and he told us the waiter would be over to attend to us. We sat for over ten minutes before getting up and leaving. The waiter completely ignored us for the entire time. There were 4 other tables of people in, so he was hardly run off his feet. Just a very bad attitude. On the flip side the reception staff were very good.
We accept the fact that the hotel has just come out of lockdown, but surely that was a great opportunity to clean and redecorate the rooms?
We appreciate that soft furnishings have had to be removed, but the advertised minibar was completely empty for no apparent reason. And the thick dust on the back of the couches is inexcusable. Our room was not cleaned during our stay and towels and shower gel etc., were not replenished. But to be fair this maybe down to COVID-19 restrictions. I’m very aware we could have asked staff for these, but at a 4 star hotel, you really expect this to happen as a matter of course. Edinburgh is our favourite city in Scotland for a break, and we always stay in 4 & 5 star hotels there. The Radisson Blu will unfortunately be off our list in the future for places to base ourselves.",5.0,Two day stay in Premier room.

We had contacted the hotel in advance, informing them of our reasons to stay, which must have been noted on our room booking as we did receive 2 complimentary drinks from the bar, which we were grateful for and enjoyed. However, the staff member at check in did not pay any attention as to why we were visiting the hotel, or even asked how we were doing when we approached him. Again, the voucher we had for a drink in the bar had ""wedding"" written on it, however the waitress never let on to it.

Breakfast is also good with the option to order things from a menu as well as a good buffet selection.," The Spa* is very deceiving from photos. This pool is tiny so please don’t book here if you actually want to be able to swim. Steam room also broke on our visit. 
I checked out and had forgotten my suit and shoes in the room. I returned a couple of hours later (same day) to collect it and was told that housekeeping couldn’t find it and so I had to fly home without it even though I knew it must of been in the building. Front of house hotel staff dealt with this matter appallingly - one member of staff even rolled her eyes and huffed and puffed at us when we said it was urgent as we had to catch a flight.
The hotel manager then stepped in and in all fairness was excellent, reassured us which was all you want as a paying customer. He said he would send me the suit when they found it (who knows how they couldn’t find it to start with being a hotel of their calibre) but anyway we left reassured we would be sent it if/ when it “showed up”.
Next day I received a call to say that they had located it and housekeeping had “put it to the side and gone home” as opposed to correctly logging it onto a system and putting it in lost property. Anyway they had my suit so that was some good news, until they tried to charge me £20-30 to post it back to me. After a stern conversation with the manager about my experience he called back to say he would send it for free. I am grateful for this but the whole thing had already ruined my stay and I won’t be returning to a Radisson group hotel again.
Such a shame as everything else was great so would have returned in the future *besides the spa point above.",7.1,Good

It was also quite tight packed where the buffet breakfast was, although that area wasn't too busy when I was in, at times I can image it would be very overcrowded.  The breakfast was cold, I don't think the heating trays were keeping the food hot enough and the plates were cold which didn't help to keep the heat in the breakfast.

2072,Australia,Superior Room,3 nights ,January 2020,Family," Location is brilliant, central yet calm, ok decor. Downstairs area for guests to sit and wait is great. Simon, the operations manager, despite his young age was very professional, energetic, smart and had outstanding listening skills and got the job done most efficiently.
He would make an outstanding hotel manager in my opinion and could be seen running everywhere 'putting out fires' due to limited staffing, I suspect.  Reckon should be poached by 5 star with more funds and better staff schedule mgt (here resources too low to do this well). Pool area is good. Spa is outsourced and has friendly personnel and good treatments. 
Bed was very comfortable and had good bedding. New room after cleaning mishap was clean and comfy and all our things were moved by them at my request so our day could keep going withoit further hassle. Check out time was flexible (12pm to 1pm) which was great for late departures/ later plane. Reception staff overall professional, responsive and doing their best. Female manager ok, but seemed just a good receptionist, not an energetic decision maker.
Great to have taxis in front of hotel and all tours close by and Edinburgh castle about 10 min away.
Airport bus connection (last stop) at bottom of hill. Steep 5-10 min walk to get to hotel, but managed with my 9 year old."," I found the place a little understaffed in the cleaning department. The second floor was disappointing, but the fifth floor was great.  I didn't like one of the male back office managers tell Stefano, one of the receptionists, off in front of guests. Very unprofessional image and putting bad atmosphere into the hotel.
Also bringing luggage up was a favour as portrayed by the tone of Stefano, so that we carried our own luggage up, which does not scream 5 star. Insisting on having luggage brought down at the end of the stay took 2 phone calls to reception and one to concierge and 30 min....Concierge only there during the day. Breakfast had lots of choices but was made up of cheap options and had nothing homemade/any local specialities.
Felt like Aldi food without the organic options. No cakes.
No walk in showers. Baths need updating. No drinks were free, not even water bottles in the room...no welcome chocolate or flowers...no personalised note...no minibar....no downturn service. Big push to become a Radisson member and getting points only if not going via booking.com. Getting room service on top of prices that were about x4 also required a delivery fee! Understaffed in high traffic times (end of breakfast- time should be extended/ check out time). Kitchen and room service personnel understaffed.

2099,United Kingdom,Standard Room,2 nights ,November 2019,Group, The food was really nice and the bar staff very friendly.," Unfortunately, the hotel had been overbooked that weekend which was not the hotel staffs' fault, but we had to stay the first night elsewhere. Initially, when they told us, they could not have been nicer: booking us to their sister hotel and offering complimentary drinks and a taxi which were great and we were not too bothered. 
However, when we got back the next day the receptionist was quite rude suggesting we had no idea what was going on and I did not know how to spell my own name which was quite insulting. The manager who we had to ask for was then lovely and knew the whole situation.  
Then we had to ask 5 times to have twin beds which was irritating, but the staff were lovely each time. They did offer us an upgrade and a free meal due to the disruption which was amazing. The meal was particularly good, but we only got drinks halfway through.

I didn't get their names but there was an Irish girl, an African chap and an American chap. They could teach the restaurant staff a thing or two about providing a service. We arrived early and checked in but the room wasn't ready so they took our bags and we went for lunch. The room was nice and clean. The shower was really powerful. The bed was extremely comfortable. No complaints about the room at all."," The buffet breakfast was terrible, probably the worst I've ever had. The staff were unfriendly and had absolutely no manners. The maitre'D (Tracy Ho) didn't appear to have please or thank you in her vocabulary. One of those who gave instructions whilst looking elsewhere rather than talking to us because she was bored of saying the same thing a 100 times. Staff were taking plates whilst one of us were still eating. The quality of food was awful. For example the bacon seemed to have just been thrown on the grill in clumps of about 8 slices so the outer 2 slices were virtually burnt with the inside slices cooked but insipid. The fried eggs were like rubber frisbees and the hash browns were inedible. I didn't try anything else as I went to look at the porridge and it was so thick it wouldn't come off the spoon so I gave up. I had tea to drink and there were 2 teabags in a large pot so no matter how long I left it and squoze the bags it was still extremely weak. I think the breakfast was £12.95 each.

The carpark although hidden around the back of the hotel is large and easy to access and the discount from the hotel is a plus., Finding a pair of knickers in the room that did not belong to my wife was not pleasant.  Also as we needed none allergenic bedding and pillows this left us with no bed topping.  Two beds pushed together were uncomfortable as you could feel the edges.  Also the doors to the rooms bang close so in a morning you can hear everyone getting up (don’t need an alarm or wake up call).  The smallest pool ever seen to match the small changing rooms.  More than two people in either and that’s them full.,6.2,Excellent location but need to work on small details as rooms let this hotel down.
2239,United Kingdom,Standard Room,1 night ,October 2018,Couple," The hotel is in a fantastic location, great for exploring the city. The bar staff were the best within the hotel - very polite, helpful and friendly. The breakfast was of good quality."," We booked this hotel stay to celebrate a milestone wedding anniversary. When using the pool/sauna facilities, the staff were rather ignorant and unhelpful when I pointed out that there was no water available and that there were piles of empty cups left around. This made me question the cleanliness of the area as obviously no-one was checking to refill the water or clean up. Similarly in the dining area for breakfast, the staff were not particularly attentive. Our table had no milk on for our coffees and when I pointed this out to a staff member he just moodily placed one in front of me. The dining area itself is incredibly tight, with very little space between each table. I felt like we were dining with a group of other people as they were so close together! Simple things like tables spread out more and tablecloths on the tables would have made the place much nicer. I also thought the room was a let down to what was pictured prior to booking - just a plain white bedsheet hastily made, no bed runner on which I thought made the rooms look appealing in the pictures. We had told them of our anniversary prior to our stay and we did have someone come to our room with a card and gift, which was a nice gesture. However the card was just addressed to myself (not the both of us - then saying Happy Anniversary - which obviously means two people are involved) and handed us one little bag with fudge in and one drinks voucher. Gave me another fudge bag when saw 2 of us. Considering it's obviously for an anniversary it would be common sense to provide two drinks vouchers so that as a couple we could enjoy our drink together. As a manager previously, I thought this just showed little thought in the actual gesture itself as there is no point providing one gesture when the celebration is obviously for two people. Overall I thought the hotel let itself down and didn't meet my expectations, which for an anniversary celebration, is sad.",6.2,"Didn't meet standards - room a disappointment, moody staff and cramped dining area."
2240,United Kingdom,Standard Room,1 night ,October 2018,Family," Sadly our stay was not as memorable as it should be due to a fire drill during the night where the fire evacuation process was very poor. There were no correct evacuation process, no fire wardens on sight when we had to evacuate. I had to wake my young children and have to go down 6 flight of stairs into the freezing cold in the middle of the night. The most disturbing thing is that the fire alarm was triggered by someone smoking on site. To our disappointment, the hotel did not take into account the distress me and my young children had to face in the middle of the night out, having to risk going down these stairs while children were half asleep into the freezing cold, extremely frightened. The hotel took no responsibility to the distress and discomfort caused to my young children. 
We tried to ask for a refund for the distress and disturbance caused. The reason I am writing this review is not that of the false alarm and but the hotel management did not seem to be too concerned about our ordeal we faced or the fact the incidence could have cost us our lives.", poor response from Hotel Management,5.8,Okay

2244,United Kingdom,Royal Mile Suite,1 night ,October 2018,Couple, The location was superb - very central and next to a lot of attractions that we wanted to visit. We never walked more than 8 minutes to get where we wanted.," After checking in at approximately 3pm, we left our room for some shopping. Upon our return it became obvious that someone had been in our room as there were some minor changes to the suite. Bedsheets had been adjusted and all of the curtains had been drawn, this wouldn’t prove to be an issue however when you know you are in possession of a number of valuables I didn’t appreciate this. 
Further to this, and more annoyingly, at approximately 12am the fire alarm began to ring out, we very quickly left the room to discover a minor state of panic amongst other guests. Of course as a health and safety procedure this wouldn’t be an issue, but what was a concern was the fact that there was no sign of any staff members in order to better organise the panic of the situation. We headed outside only to be ushered round the corner by a staff member on a cigarette break. There was no attempt to head count/ensure that everyone was evacuated and then later accounted for upon returning into the building. There was a considerate lack of communication regarding what had caused the alarm, and what the resolution had been. This is concerning given the presence of two fire engines.
The following morning we received a knock on the door to fill up the mini bar for the next guests, despite us requesting a late check out. At this point we were still getting ready for the day. 
Lastly, the light on the side of the wardrobe (above the kettle) was flickering throughout the night despite being switched off which prevented a good nights sleep.",5.8,Didn’t meet expectations

Perhaps left over from room cleaning earlier?  (This improved later in tbe evening.) Also, on one occasion on our last day, the elavator to the car park had some maggots on the floor in the corner. This was witnessed by one of the cleaning staff who said she'd get somebody onto it. Perhaps somebody had dropped some food in the past.

Also, as it was a special occasion for us, they upgraded us and we had a bottle of bubbly in the room which was a nice touch!   Due to COVID and the local restaurants being closed at night, we had to eat in the restaurant each evening and although it was a reduced menu, the meals were excellent.  The location of the hotel was perfect for what we wanted to see in Edinburgh.  The staff were also very attentive and helpful."," Apparently (due to COVID restrictions) they were unable to play music in the restaurant/at breakfast which really took away any atmosphere, especially as there were so few guests.
Service at breakfast was a bit too quick - each morning we were still eating our cereal/fruit when the cooked meal arrived!

The staff at the Melrose Spa were wonderful, the facilities were clean and safe for Covid-19 measures, the pool was warm and empty, and we had a great neck, shoulder and back massage."," The room did show signs of age - the furniture was a little rough around the edges, the metal backing of the bed had quite a lot of scuffs that just made the room look less polished. The shower screen was a little loose although it did the job. It wasn't possible to screencast to the TV which was a bit of a shame. 
Entrance to the hotel from the car park did feel a little strange as the signs were not very clear and everything looks a bit bare and stark.

We had pre booked a table in the hotel restaurant before arrival. We didn’t select the time, it was allocated to us. When we arrived for our table at 7pm we were advised that we wouldn’t be able to sit in the restaurant as we had children and they are not allowed in the restaurant after 8pm, (it would have been good to know this in advance).

2501,United Kingdom,,3 nights ,December 2019,Family, I liked the location for sure and the in room dinning menu was excellent. Good facilities in hotel.," For a four star category hotel, the rooms could have been better. We took a suite room but apart from size, nothing was impressing and the room was very impractical. The common room could have been much better too. eg. the door stopper of bathroom was positioned just outside the tub so you would alway land up stepping on it while walking out of bath tub and hurt your self. The height of the mini bar was high so it was difficult for people who are not tall to operate the kettle as it wasn't visible. The kettle itself was not very good and stable and burnt our hand with steam several times. The 2nd bathroom didn't have any soap dish to keep the soap bar. The shower water pipe was too small for us to use it as hand shower. The living room was very dark. The lighting could have been better. There were few lamps which couldn't be switched on as there was no power plug around it. There was only 1 remote for two television sets. The storage was not sufficient. There should have been storage with shelf but there was none. The storage in the living room had a big hole at its base so unusable. No tissue box in the room. etc etc.",5.0,Good location & facility but room needs to be relooked into and should be more practical to use.

2509,United Kingdom,,1 night ,October 2019,Couple, I liked the central location and exterior appeal of the hotel.  It is also near Waverley station and the old town.  The rest of the hotel failed to meet my expectations of a £280+ pn hotel., One member of the reception staff was unfriendly.  The room was two single beds and not one large double bed.
