34,United Kingdom,Standard Room,2 nights ,December 2020,Couple,," The few things that I was disappointed with this time were closer of the gym and spa facilities, which we weren’t aware of when booking.

Bar area was very good and the food there was hot and tasty."," A £25 secure parking charge is very expensive! 
We feel that the hotel is generally a little dated and needs upgrading to compete with other similar properties, eg. Bedroom decor, TV  and restaurant area.

366,United Kingdom,Superior Room with River view,1 night ,November 2019,Couple," Check in was fast, and easy. Receptionist was informative and very helpful. Myself, and partner ate food and enjoyed some drinks at the “White Bar” situated in the lobby area, food was very nice, expensive but it was good. The facilities were great, the gym was spacious and had a good variety of machines, didn’t manage to use the spa. But, both were complimentary with a nights stay. We ordered breakfast to our room at no extra charge, after paying at reception for it, the price was around £20 for us both. We ordered for 9am, and it was delivered bang on the time. The food was hot and nice, we received extras including croissants, fruit, orange juice and toast with a variety of sauces and jams. Although, we had both ordered coffees and this didn’t come with our breakfast. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and stay."," Upon arrival of the property, there was a strange odour within the lobby area that myself and partner both noticed and said. We stayed on the fifth floor and there was also a strong smell of paint right a long the corridor, the paint smell can’t be helped obviously and there was plenty of signs to indicate what was still wet etc, but the smell in the lobby wasn’t the best start - wasn’t unbearable but wasn’t pleasant either. Our room was okay, it seemed quite dated and was clean enough. One of our bathroom lights was broke and flicked constantly when switched on, the tube needs replaced (room 508 - floor 5). Our bed was very low to the ground, and slanted. It felt as though I was a lot higher up than my partner, but I think this reason was because it was two king beds that had been pushed together to create the double. The pillows, and quilts were both comfortable and warm though. In the morning after what was an okay sleep we went to make a coffee each, when we had a look at the tea and coffee condiments there was a handful of different teas, plenty of sugar and sweetener but only one sachet of coffee, I don’t know if this was a mistake or the normality but was a problem for us as we both enjoy a coffee in the morning, what made it worse was that we had also ordered two with our breakfasts in the morning to the room, and it turned up without any coffee, and instead just orange juice which we didn’t order. Check out was fine and again pleasant, and we are certain that if we raised the issue with a member of staff they would have been kind enough to sort our demands. It wasn’t the best stay but can’t fault the staff, I just think I have for sure stayed in better Radisson’s elsewhere in different cities than this one and they have perhaps set a higher standard than this particular establishment.",7.9,Good Facilities and Friendly Staff.

My room was apparently cleaned on a daily basis but was not cleaned properly.  I paid for an upgrade, the light fittings on the bed was broken.  Finally, what I was most amazed at was there was only three sockets in the room.  Two on the desk and one on a wall.  There were none by the bed.",6.7,Pleasant

424,United Kingdom,Standard Room,1 night ,September 2019,Couple," The location was just perfect for where we wanted to be in Liverpool. Just around the corner from the panoramic 34 restaurant. Very close to the liver building and a short stroll to the Albert Dock and to all the shops. Parking was separate but only £13 for 24 hours in a secure car park close by. The use of the swimming pool, sauna and steam room was good. Breakfast was good. We asked for a quiet room and it was the most quiet room I have ever had in a hotel and slept very well.", What I found most bizarre was on checking out my husband and I were asked to wait in reception area so that a telephone call could be made for someone to check our room for damage before they would give us our deposit back. We are both 60 years old and hardly look like hell raisers! We were both made to feel like criminals. I have never experienced this in any hotel I’ve stayed in all over the world. In fact in the last eight weeks I have stayed in 12 hotels and never made to feel like this. Suffice to say that our room was immaculately left and we were given our deposit back eventually.,9.2,Wonderful

Locationwise the hotel is on the outskirts of L1.", The first upgraded room we were allocated had a cracked sink and the bath surround was broken. The view from the window of the river Mersey was lovely but the window surround was black with condensation as there were no vents.  When I complained at reception we were immediately relocated to another room. Here the bathroom was much nicer and the window surround clean. Unfortunately the air conditioning in this room did not work at all. Luckily we were given a fan by staff. Without this our night's sleep would have been very unpleasant. These are not the type of issues one expects to encounter at a four star hotel especially when we've paid extra for an upgrade.,7.0,Rooms a little disappointing.

The Hotel does have excellent views across the River Mersey, but the location is a long walk from the nearest Merseyrail station at Moorfields, and there is no other public transport nearby.

Walked in staff just stood talking had to find ourselves a clean table. Coffee machines not working, no glasses for juices and hardly any food out, had to wait for fresh food to be brought out when ran out. This was a busy time granted at 10am in the morning, but a hotel of this capacity should be able to cope. Not worth £9.95 per person sorry.

It was served everyday except one, and surely the amount of scrambled egg being left uneaten on plates tells you something?? I asked for a fried egg, and that was OK, but if there was any chance of a cooked to order omlette, I didn't see the sign. There wasn't much fresh fruit, and it was mostly the same. Finally, I know coffee machines are a labour-saving device, but for the cost of the breakfast and the star rating of the hotel, It was not OK to be using a coffee machine, similar to one I saw the other day in Kwik-Fit!!

Great size room and bed was massive and comfortable. Slept really well.

617,United Kingdom,Standard Room,1 night ,June 2019,Group," Food was fine, always has sufficient items on offer and is hot."," I was disappointed this time with the bed situation. I had asked about getting the beds split and was promised someone would come and do it that evening, no one showed. So I called down the next morning and was again promised it would be done, but to no avail. Also housekeeping did not turn up until 3.30 on the Friday at which point we could not let her come in and make beds etc as we were getting ready to attend an event. The rooms were very warm and were difficult to cool down",8.3,"Really like this hotel, the little bits of annoyances would not put me off staying here again"

They have limited parking elsewhere and charge £25 per day!!!! When we arrived we were told 'the parking was first come first served' and so we had to sort ourselves out. We were very unhappy about this.
The bar in the hotel is sooo expensive, a double Malibu and coke cost £10!!! Won't be going there again. 
The whirlpool in the spa is very cold, just as cold as the swimming pool.",8.3,A few pros and cons but overall we enjoyed our stay.

The housekeeping was quick and responsive when we found out there was no remote for the TV."," The check in clerk did not explain how to use the lifts, which had a security card system. The room cards kept losing their information and needed to be re-charged to enable us to enter our room, this almost made us late for a family event. The room décor was like something out of ""Twin Peaks"" red curtains, furniture, an appearance of seventies décor, dark and oppressive. there was a fridge in the room but was not operating, was told by a smug receptionist that this was a mini-bar and was not a fridge !!
The breakfast items often run out, no glasses, bread for toast, Hot water for tea, hot food items, staff ignored me when I requested restocking, I overheard one staff member state that the items should not be replenished as it was getting late, this was an hour before the breakfast should have ended.",6.7,Pleasant

The cards to activate the lifts didn’t work even after they were “reactivated” 3 times, we weren’t the only people with this problem as every time we went to use the life there was already some stuck in there. When being checked in the girl on reception assumed my £6 change was a tip and put it straight in her pocket.

Then finding the room to be really hot and airconditoner dial broken  so having to move to another room to be able to cool down which took some time, also awaiting ice buckets from reception as the ice machine on our floor was also broken.  The refrigerators in the rooms have also been ""decommissioned"" which we'd also not expected, our mistake apparently, and are now cupboards (although not even clean!).

I asked for the bed to be changed while we were out and this wasn’t done which meant I had to sleep in a twin bed which meant me and my partner basically had a single bed for Valentine’s Day of all days so I was far from happy.
They did comp breakfast for us and knock 20 pound off the bill to be fair but I would have preferred the issues never occurred in the first place.
I also didn’t like the fact that there was no clear way to contact reception via the telephone. I had to ask at reception what number to ring but you’d think it would be on the phone or in the room, also there wasn’t a hair dryer so we had to request one to be brought up.
They upgraded us to a business room with the promise of bottled water as a gesture of good will for the messing about but the water never arrived, we had to request it from reception and even then it was warm when it came.

The staff are always lovely and approachable in the hotel, restaurant and in the spa area. Me and my partner did not book a table at the restaurant, and even though they were quite busy the staff done what they good to get us seat, to which we were very grateful. One of my favourite things about stay here is the comfort of the rooms, especially the beds. Warning: if you plan on staying up late to do work, stay far away from the bed because once the the blackout curtains are closed and you get slightly comfy on the bed I guarantee you will be out like a light. Check out time being 12pm is brilliant as it gives you that little extra time in the comfy beds. Will be staying again when I have an excuse."," I wouldn't stay I ""didn't like"" but a minor note worth mentioning for anyone planning on using the spa facilities: the swimming pool is only accessible via swirly stairs, which were quite slippery so extra care is needed when accessing that area. Feedback for the spa treatments would be that I felt the treatments (back massage and facial) ended sooner than I would have like.

I made this booking from Melbourne, Australia and this was a Christmas gift for my parents who live in Liverpool, England.  I noted that it would not be me who would be checking in, and gave the booking contact name and details.  When my parents attempted to check in, there were told that they had to pay for the room as they didn't have my credit card.  They were hit with a $311.61 (1 hundred and 72 pound) bill!!  My parents called me immediately and I spoke with Dinah on reception who was rude and unhelpful and passed the blame to Booking.com for not providing the hotel payment policy correct information.  I was told to call back on Monday (the booking was for a Saturday) and that I would need to speak with the hotel accounts team.  Since my booking was non refundable, even if my parents refused to stay, I would have still been charged!!  My Mum paid the $311.61 on her credit card and they continued with their planned hotel stay.  They had a really nice time, but the whole trip was tainted by the first encounter and the worry that they had to foot a very expensive hotel stay, when they only lived 40 minutes out of the city!  I called the accounts team as advised by Dinah on Monday and spoke to a really helpful lady called Natalia who apologized for the incident, processed a refund on Mums card and confirmed that the payment would be taken from my card, as originally planned.  The whole incident was very stressful and took the excitement, fun, and Christmas cheer away from the fact that this was supposed to be a Christmas present - it cut into my parents spending money and they spent the rest of the day/night being very careful with what they spent just incase the refund request was declined on the Monday when I was advised to call.",7.5,"Lovely hotel, great location, rude and unsympathetic reception staff!"

It was refreshingly nice!," The valet service - I was told to call 30 mins before I wanted my car and it would be brought round. I did this, and was called back after 20 mins and told there was no driver to bring my car round. I would have to be walked over to their secure parking facility to retrieve my car myself.  I was a bit miffed as this was done without any apologies for the inconvenience. I mentioned it at check out and was told the maximum discount they could offer was £5. The approach of the person was all wrong. A simple apology and offer to take £5 off the parking bill would have sufficed, rather than saying ""the max discount I can offer is £5"". This is especially because I only said ""it would be nice to apologise for the inconvenience or at least offer something for the inconvenience. I did pay for a valet service that I am not receiving in its entirety"".  It's simply good customer service and I didn't receive it. Instead, I felt a bit insulted!

Adjoining to another couple who came in at 4am and we could hear EVERYTHING including the mans breathing. The beds were pushed together to make a double.

I made a complaint whilst I was there at the hotel.   The toilet seat was loose and didn’t fit the bowl, it slipped and felt very uncomfortable. We were unable to close the  shower screen due to poor fit ( wasn’t fit for purpose).   We had to put a towel on the floor at the side of bath to collect all the water running down the screen.  Also on our last night the wash bowl began to leak from the plug underneath the bowl onto the floor below.   Not what we expect from Radisson. Couldn’t recommend this hotel due to the inadequate bathroom facilities. And poor maintanence of them.",6.7,Didn’t spoil our stay because we love Liverpool and have stayed at this hotel before.

The breakfast is great too - look on the menu cards on the table not just the buffet. Oh and the beds are huge and super comfortable.," The rooms seem a little tired, the water took ages to run out of the sink, the laminate flooring had gaps by the door, the tiles in the bathroom had been bodged together and the aircon wasn't great so all in, slightly disappointing for £150 / night (inc breakfast). Also, beware the cost of parking, the hotel has nothing on site, valet parking is £25 / for each 24hrs. The cheapest is capital parking round the corner which costs £13.50 for 24 hours but you have to pay each time you get the car out so can get quite a bit more expensive if you're not just going out for the day.",7.1,Lovely staff but frayed around the edges
1035,United Kingdom,Standard Room,1 night ,October 2018,Family, Hotel is a little way outside the recognised city centre but an easy enough walk to the waterfront and its attractions.

I had notified in advance that it was a celebration and a small plate of cakes was a nice touch.," Would have given a higher rating if we had not had to call reception because there was no remote control for the TV, and then a second time as the hairdryer was also missing. Also, oddly, whilst there were decorative voiles at the window there were no proper curtains. On 7th floor so privacy so annissubut it did mean we woke early as room was light",7.5,Nice hotel with added bonus of small pool and spa facilities
1056,United Kingdom,Standard Room,3 nights ,October 2018,Group, Room had a waterfront view and beds were extremely comfortable.  There was a wide range of items at breakfast - and the times were quite wide ranging.  Staff were courteous and helpful both front of house and in dining/bar area.," Room was only serviced once and on our request over the time of our stay meaning that bins were not emptied and bathroom not cleaned - unsure what the problem was.  Some of the room lighting was confusing or not working at all.  Problems with the room keys malfunctioning regularly which necessitated a visit to Reception each time before we could access the room.  I personally used the facilities in the fitness suite (pool) but there were too many flights of stairs to ascend and descend for me as I have some joint problems.
The bar area, while pleasant, was quite chilly in places.",7.1,While room was comfortable felt overall hotel not up to Radisson Blu usual standards.

1070,United Kingdom,Superior Room with River view,3 nights ,October 2018,Couple," Bed v comfy, pillows likewise, front desk staff very friendly and helpful, pool and spa very pleasant (pool not big but good enough to swim lengths in a fairly dedicated manner), lifts good, overall quiet hotel, position quite good, parking facility useful, restaurant choice of meals quite good, breakfast choice excellent, overall cleanliness excellent."," The room information was erroneous in that it said there was a fridge, but the policy has changed and all the fridges have been decommissioned. The front desk staff are happy to put things in a small fridge but you have to keep going up and down for that. There is a small ice bucket in the room with ice stations on each landing. Not anything like as good as having a fridge in the room though (we'd had plans for keeping some picnic-type stuff in the fridge and had to abandon that idea.)  The TVs were not working properly while we were there and this was a total hotel problem (except for the bar area) and the technicians were having trouble putting it right. We feel it was too expensive for what was on offer, although that is just a personal view. (Having said that, it you make good use of the pool and gym you are recouping a bit of the expense!) The restaurant was probably a bit on the dear side (but then so are a lot of eating places around the centre - we checked some of them out in passing). Finally, some might find it a little further away from the centre and main part of the waterfront than desired (incl. the river cruise start point opposite the Liver Building which is 12 mins' walk away, also the hop-on hop-off bus start points, and the Museum of Liverpool. The National Trust minibus tour of the Beatles Houses starts from Jury's Inn which is 25 mins' brisk walk away near Albert Dock, and the John Lewis area of shops would be about 20 mins. The cathedrals would probably be about 25 - 30 minutes' walk - bit less coming back as you are going downhill!)  - so check out the position to be sure, before booking. As it happened we didn't mind at all once we'd got our bearings, and we walked miles all over Liverpool (felt like it anyway!) and it was quite convenient to get back to. Otherwise it is not hard to get a taxi.",8.3,"We enjoyed staying here in spite of any negative points I have made, and Liverpool is a great city!"

Latch on the door was broken so had to screw it in every time we opened the door and there was only 1 sink (2 shown on the pictures). The mini bar was empty and found sweets on the floor, a hair in the bed and a dusty windowsill. Breakfast wasn't great; very little fruit out and the scrambled eggs were questionable. We were told to sit where we wanted at breakfast which was fine, but when we came back from the buffet found that our seats had been taken and had to find somewhere else. Used the pool and gym facilities which were ok. The whirlpool was out of order and everything's looking a little run down. The gym could definitely do with an upgrade and we had to stand and wait for gym staff to finish their conversation with each other at reception before being able to go in",7.1,Not as great as expected

Can always go for breakfast nearby as a lot of cafes local. Fab location.", House keeping was poor. Basic cleaning was poor standard especially for the 2nd night of our stay. Really disapointing because rooms are gorgeous. Did not remove dirty mugs or refresh room other than bedding. Simple things that were definitely not to a 4 star standard.

The function room itself was sound insulated, but the noise was on the outside landings - due to the design of the hotel the sound carries around the central, open areas.",7.5,Good
1097,United Kingdom,Standard Room,1 night ,October 2018,Group, the room was a typical corporate hotel room whihc is fine as I was travelling for business.  The room was clean and comfortable," the morning after I realized that the housekeepr was putting complimentary water in the rooms she was cleanign (seen the trolley outside the room next door) hoever myself and my colleague did not find any complimentary water with in the room. Also I was meant to leave at 12pm and left the DND card on the handle outside but the housekeepr still kncked my door at 11.30 whilist under the shower which was irritating.

Our room was spacious and had everything we needed... iron, board and hair dryer. 
New towels everyday, our bed was made and our rubbish taken away. 
The bar area downstairs was very convenient for a much needed drink after a long day of shopping at Liverpool One."," We didn't like that the restaurant staff made us feel un-welcome. We waited 45 minutes for our food... which was frustrating because a lonely customer eating on his own has his starter and main before we'd simply had our mains. Almost 1 hour later and our food still hadn't arrived. But then... the fire alarm went off and the building had to be evacuated (false alarm). We'd have appreciated being told there was a drill.. we have stayed at hotels before and they have told us when to expect their drill -  but we weren't, and we just had to sit and wait that little while longer. There wasn't an apology or would you like another drink for the delay.. very disappointed!",7.9,10 minute walk to centre - lovely hotel - better to eat out!

It seems the brand standard is 2 and in my view this needs to change as even in a small guest house you get more than this.

Did use the swimming pool and sauna but wasn’t told where steam room was. No cups for water in the swim  area and no bags for wet swim suits until you asked at reception - could be reducing plastic which is a positive move but signs up would help and plastic cups could be changed to paper. Also if looking to reduce plastic no need to replace toiletries each day.

There were only about 10 channels available and no on screen information as to what the channels were showing. Picture and sound quality when we did find something to watch was abysmal. There was no access to ""normaI"" Freeview channels. I did mention this to Reception on check out and was told the hotel was having issues with their provider (Sky I believe).

Disappointed a bit with it compared to other Radisson Blu hotels we've stayed in. Had to bring clothes and belongings poolside as we hadn't been told before that the lockers required your own lock and none were offered for purchase.

The location was convenient for centre of town attractions which were mostly within comfortable walking distance.," Maintenance of bathroom was lacking - sink plug needed fixing as the sink drained very slowly leaving the sink dirty. Also the shower screen needed attention as it allowed water to drain onto floor. Breakfast service was not well organised, we were left having ordered a cooked dish which didn't materialise.

We had issues with one o the rooms as we booked an extra double bed but the had simply put twin beds together that the hadnt even zipped up or connected together hence kept falling in between the two beds, this was sorted out the next day and we received a refund for the inconvinience.  TV channels are basic, they are no sockets by the bedsides to charge phones or anything, instead they are by the dressing table which is not near the beds? had to buy an extension lead to have our phones charging by bedside .",7.5,"Good break, but the little things can make a difference i.e sockets by the bedside and mini bar"

1219,United Kingdom,Premium Room with River View,2 nights ,August 2018,Couple," Just spent two nights bed & breakfast at this hotel and had a great stay. We travelled by train as hotel was within easy reach of Lime st station. Had we have gone by car, parking appeared to be extremely limited, although there is a secure car park in the same st, for a cost. Booked a superior room, which was both clean & comfortable and actually exceeded my expectations. Breakfast on both days was excellent, varied, well cooked, presented & hot. Staff were extremely helpful, polite & friendly. I would definitely stay again and wouldn’t hesitate in recommending this hotel to friends or family.", We have no complaints whatsoever. We had a shortage of complimentary drinks sachets in the room when we arrived. But a call to reception and a member of staff arrived with a bag full of replacements.,8.8,"Lovely hotel, ran by efficient, courteous & friendly staff. All in all a brilliant few days away"
1220,United Kingdom,Premium Room with River View,2 nights ,August 2018,Couple, The staff were incredibly polite and efficient.," The rooms were in need of an upgrade. We complained about the first room as there was paint peeling off the walls, the leather furniture was scuffed and shabby and the carpet was badly stained. The room we moved to was marginally better but still very budget looking. Having stayed at the Raddison in Manchester, we were shocked and very disappointed at quality of the rooms. It just felt shabby and quality inn standard.",6.7,Needs an upgrade

1225,United Kingdom,Standard Room,2 nights ,August 2018,Group," The staff was fantastic and their standard of service excellent. The location is very good (Moorsfields station has a direct access until 7pm from the hotel's street) if you need to connect with Merseyrail. Otherwise, the hotel is within a short distance to Lime St Station, shopping area and main sightseeing landmarks. If you use Uber, it is cheap and quick if you travel in a group.
Access to swimming pool and gym was a plus.
Regardless of the things I didn't like, the hotel is a good choice when getting a discount offer for your stay as we did in our group. Wifi was excellent. This 'dislikes' shouldn't put anyone off when deciding to stay on this hotel."," There are removing the fridges so having an empty cabinet with wires on the back of it wasn't ideal.
Travelling with people who spoke Spanish, no having such a channel in the TV offer, even if advertised, was a bit of disappointment. In the age of digital channels, analogue or bad quality ones was not a nice touch either. The hotel needs some revamp, which I believe it might be in the pipeline as I write this. Especially some floor tiles in the bathroom or small details which should be easy to fix.",8.3,Business people will find it suitable for its location; visitors will depend on the budget.

Overall the room was amazing, with an awesome view."," The breakfast was extremely disappointing.  From having great rooms and such a nice play to stay, alongside good value for money, the food was a major let down.  The eggs were watery and had no flavor.  The dining room was full of dirty tables and not enough staff.  We had no idea how to check in for breakfast and were only asked once we'd seated.  The coffee was only machine coffee, not great for a 4 star hotel.  We also had to go hunting for our own cutlery which didn't appear to exist.",8.8,"Overall a great stay, but the restaurant portion needs work."

When we went for a meal at night time, we enjoyed our meal, it was excellent. We were given a receipt to sign and note our room number, and we just assumed we would pay in the morning on checkout. We were wrong. After our meal we received a phone call to ask to come down and pay, which wasn't a problem.

1615,United Kingdom,Standard Room,1 night ,February 2020,Solo traveler, As I entered in the room was visible it’s very clean and well organised," I was  giving to stay the room 313 and the major problem was bathroom - for me the bathroom should be a very cosy place where you  can relax taking a shower or a hot bathtub. Unfortunately the bathroom (toilet area and the shower) is designed for people with disabilities. There are people without any issues but there are people (like me) with different phobias and for me isn’t cool at all to use the bathroom and  being kind of scared of this facilities- very uncomfortable... there’s a must to be described all this facilities at the stage when you’re booking your stay - as when I booked the room wasn’t specified anything about that and definitely  wouldn’t be what I could ask for.
I’m pointing all this not expecting to be recompensed for this “unexcited experience”, I just believe all this missed details can be fixed and leave an amazing impact on your customers otherwise your staff (at the reception and in the morning at the restaurant at the breakfast  - I interacted only with them) were very friendly and helpful and is sad to see your staff hard work and delivering good customer service and to loose customers for such important details that somehow been neglected.

What is it that is difficult to understand about a quiet room and the need for a good night's sleep. Put you in rooms opposite the lift or by these types of doors !! ?.

Both were not given to us. Response was they had sold out of these. Don't know why they were offered when neither could be accommodated. Disappointed, as it was clearly stated when we made the booking it was for my friends birthday........The pool facilities are very poor. The pics make it look far better. The pool is cold, old and tired. The sauna is good, but the steam room is luke warm, plus its up-stairs (we found it as we wete leaving). The pool and sauna is accessed via a very un-health and safety spiral staircase. 
We were phoned twice in the morning, then they hung up? This was before our check-out time of midday. The cleaner tried to get in, again before our midday check-out.

Plenty of plug sockets, additional USB sockets would be advantageous too."," I'd thought that I'd pre booked breakfast when I booked the room, but it turned out that I hadn't. The receptionist was pretty snotty with me when I asked for a couple of minutes to double check my emails to ensure that I hadn't booked breakfast, and didn't end up paying again.  She was just desperate to charge us an extortionate amount rather than wait for me to check.  In hindsight I wish I hadn't have purchased breakfast anyway as it wasn't great.  Undercooked bacon, overcooked tomatoes and hash browns.... empty fruit selections.  I should have saved my money and found another establishment to have breakfast.  Location was further out of the city centre than I had hoped, and it was a nightmare to get to and from.  View of docks from our room (specifically booked a river view)  blocked by building works over the road.  Bathroom needed some attention...wasn't spotless as I'd assume, and once housekeeping had been done on our second day, only half of the tiles had been replenished.

The reception area and the bar were nicely decorated.," The rooms were very dated, with no plugs anywhere near the bed.  This is my pet hate in the 21st century!!  The air conditioning was poor and very noisy.  The facilities in the room were very basic, the mini-bar/fridge had been removed and there was no complementary water.  There were no additional pillows and when we requested some from reception they failed to turn up.  The hotel is based in a largely business area that is being heavily renovated so there are few restaurants, bars or other facilities nearby.  The road outside the hotel was closed due to construction and the nearest car-park was supposed to be 5 mins walk away but was more like 10.  The breakfast was a very basic buffet which was all self-service including coffee and toast so was more like a Service Station than a Radisson Blu.  The restaurant seating was a very odd design with tables of two sat almost next to each other.  The two coffee machines produced individual cups at a very, very slow rate, individually grinding each cup.  Jugs of coffee served by waiting staff would be far more efficient and a much better service to customers.  There were only scrambled eggs on the buffet and no additional options presented, the hash browns were anaemic and it was like a treasure hunt to find small plates for the cold food.  All in all a disappointing experience when compared to other hotels in the chain that we've stayed at.",5.4,Disappointing for a Radisson Blu - over-priced.

After nearly 2 hours I enquired when the food would arrive, they phoned 10 mins later and told me they hadn't received the order, and could sort it in 20 mins.

Asked to check in early as had two babies with me I was advised could check in early and to ask for the lady (Deena) when I arrived. So I arrived with a suitcase, crib, bag with bottle preps and tow babies in two to be told I could no longer check in early. And if I wanted to they could downgrade me which would cost more money but smaller bed which was a no as we had a bigger bed for a reason with 4 of us in a room.!!! Went back 4/5 times to ask about check in and was told to come back in 10/15 minutes each time! This was very stressful as they was fully aware the wedding was starting at 12 in their hotel and I had all my luggage with me plus the two babies! . Eventually the wedding started and we only got to check in exactly at the check in time! Was very unhelpful! 
The room once got in it was old and worn and smelt like it had been cleaned by a damp cloth all over!!

Checked in at 10pm and asked whether the rooms I asked for were correct, to which the receptionist said yes. Once entering rooms I realised that the they were both twin. after calling reception, they would not agree that there was a fault or tries to accommodate us accordingly. In fact, their response was to sort out with Booking.com, which is poor customer service. One of the rooms did not have any shower gel, just shampoo and conditioner. the same room did not have working AC and the maintenance guy offered me a fan instead, after he tried to fix (the dial was broken).

Bathroom was a good size and clean. Bed was comfortable.," We arrived early and we knew we would have to wait until 3pm - this was discussed and acknowledged by us up front.  However, the reception staff kept advising that it MIGHT be available earlier, so we kept hanging at the hotel, being a tad travel weary.  It would have been better to have been told that the room was definitely not available until 3pm - and not raise our expectations.  Staff at reception were unfriendly and not usefully informative.   The experience did not get better from there.  The restaurant is easily the worst one we have experienced in our travels to date (4 weeks) around Europe and UK.  Rubbery and tasteless  food on the hot plates eg: scrambled eggs sitting in their own whey three breakfasts running; the best items being the sausages, bacon and tomatoes, which were at best, tepid; coffee not pleasant, sticky tables, One evening meal not available at 8.30pm on a Saturday as had run out of food - only Room Service available (?);  Fridges in room ""being decommissioned"", so no cold water;  all the glassware etc available ..   Here is the list we gave to Reception and left in the room as well :  Poor toilet flushing;  airconditioning unit very loud.  9 floors up, so if you turn it off, the room is too stuffy to sleep;  chair at table very unstable, looked as if it might implode when someone sat on it;  shower support loose- did not hold shower head upright or firmly;  shower door seal leaks creating a very wet floor - could slip.

The pool in area is in desperate need of repair and the stairs to the pool are far from clean or safe - the whole feel of the pool and spa area was very tired. 
The breakfast was like something you would get at a service station. When asking for things like beans and then jam we were just told ‘there isn’t any. None at all’. This was one hour before the breakfasts finished. 
The overall look in the foyer area was nice but really that’s where it stops.

The TV seems only to have 5 analogue channels and the controller is intermittent.
There are no biscuits and the mini bar has nothing in it (staff advised all room fridges had been decommissioned)
The drawers have no sides so clothing falls out. 
We have already had to make a trip to reception because both the room cards stopped working. My wife got stranded in the fitness centre vestibule because the key card did not work.
We were told free lockers were available in the fitness centre, however when we got there we were told a £1 coin is needed to rent padlocks (the attendant did lend us 2 free when we told him we had no change).
The male toilet light was faulty.
The spa area is quite shabby with various damage and areas of bare plaster, we did not feel the area was very hygienic. The changing rooms are poorly furnished with no costume dryers, unspecified product, no obvious moisturiser or conditioner.
I raised these items with staff, they responded positively, offered a room upgrade and free breakfast. I declined the room upgrade as I didn't want to move clothing etc. for 1 night in a better room.",5.0,Disappointed

2275,United Kingdom,Premium Room with River View,2 nights ,March 2019,Couple," ARK health Centre is good.
Location was nice and central.
Lobby was clean and tidy."," So first impressions of this hotel were very good, the location of the hotel is pretty good too, I requested a room with a view of the river outside and the hotel provided this.
The main lobby is very modern and clean with access into the restaurant and bar area, the check in area was a little busy but only took a few minutes to clear.
This is where we get to the bad bit... The room, from the description on the website was meant to be a really nice room.. I was visiting for birthday celebrations so naturally chose what I thought would be a nice hotel. Upon entering the room, we noted how dated the room was looking and that it was not modern to the same standard as the main lobby area.
The bed was actually quite comfortable and we had a sitting chair and a table chair along with pen, paper and a phone. The website advertised a free bottle of water in your room, this was not provided. We also wasn't informed that the mini bars in the room had been deactivated so there was no supplied stock and no where to store any chilled items we may have brought with us. The TV was a bit of a let down, it had just over 10 standard definition aerial channels, if you were lying on your bed and was trying to watch one of the channels, you would struggle due to the poor picture quality. By the windows (last couple of pictures) we have clear evidence of mold and this was one of the biggest let downs of a radisson blu hotel, I expected this to be a non-existent problem in a 4 star hotel.. How this hotel is still 4 star baffles me.
The bathroom was quite modern with a nice sink, but again we had issues with mold being around the bath and shower area. On our first night we noticed that the adjustable shower head was broken so we couldn't change the setting and the temperature was either artic or desert (freezing cold, boiling hot), there was no Inbetween.
Probably the nicest part was the downstairs spa and fitness area.",5.8,Not worth 4 Stars.
2276,United Kingdom,Standard Room,2 nights ,March 2019,Couple, Room was comfortable and clean. Staff were friendly, Pool and spa facilities were poor. How to use the lift was not explained when we checked in. Television in the room was difficult to watch due to where it was located.,5.8,Okay

This is not a good hotel to see it from.," When we arrived we were allocated the Wong room type - we had paid extra for the deluxe river view - we were told at first that the hotel was full and we couldn’t have what we paid for. Some argument and a long wait later and we got what we paid for. 
There was only one small pillow each in the room and no robes or slippers for the spa (as advertised). We asked nicely and were told that the hotel was too full for more than one pillow each (4 star hotel ?!?!) and that we simply could not have robes. Another heated call and a wait and they appeared also. Okay so we got them but at a 4 star hotel you should not have to ask and if you do ask you should not have to complain.
The pastries and rolls at breakfast were stale and had obviously been carried over from Saturday.
When it came time to leave they made a complete mess of the taxi booking. We asked for a taxi at the required time and gave almost 2 hours notice. A taxi arrived but would not take us without a code from reception and reception had either lost or did not know about the code. So we were late to the station.

delay and our breakfast was on the way to our room. My wife called again

The room was terrible it said we would have a river view hence the higher price, when really we had a steamed up window which over looked a building site. We was on the 5th floor and seen not even half the river due to cranes etc so we felt ripped off as we was in a less than standard room!! We then come to check out on Sunday and the lifts were broke so after waiting 15 minutes for a lift that never come we tried to find stairs down, well what a surprise we found stairs which took us to the basement and there was no way out, we had to walk half way back up and then walk to the lifts on another floor to get down. £224 is a small holiday for someone, we decided to splash out an go for the room that would make it special and it was abysmal, well over priced and I will never stay here again, not even so much as a complimentary bottle of water for £224.",4.6,Disappointing

We will definitely be staying here wen we come next time to see our son at who is at John Moore’s University."," No hotel information folder. There was no info in the room on the spa services or hotel services with prices. Not enough  tea/coffee in room. We personally drink a lot of tea/coffee and had to ring down a couple times. 
No info on the little capsules to know what they are as there was no names on them. So that was disappointing. As first time visitors to Liverpool the hotel was great.",9.6,Our Trip
2546,United Kingdom,Standard Room,3 nights ,October 2018,Family, Staff were very friendly and helpful. Building looked impressive. Food was good.," We booked the hotel as we were specifically looking for a 4* experience, in particular the gym, spa and pool facilities. Extremely disappointed as the steam room was out of action the entire time and the gym was closed for 2/4 days. Other areas that fell below expectation:
- lovely bar with cocktail menu: at least half of cocktails not available due to bar no longer stocking ingredients
- inadequate heating in room: despite being on max, the temperature of one of our rooms was very cool 
- toilets didn't flush properly in either room, sink was blocked in one
- fridge not working in either room
- televisions not working for the first day and intermittent fault over the next couple of days: husband had planned to stay in and watch Grand Prix, this was not possible
Staff were very friendly and tried to help, but the facilities were definitely not the 4* we were expecting, more like 2*. Won't be booking into a Radisson again.",4.6,Disappointing

It is filthy and understaffed . The dirt in our hotel room. The balls of dust behind the bed. The broken lights in our room. The damp in our bathroom. The dirt in the bathroom. The room service tray left outside our neighbours door with remains of breakfast which was left there for 24 hours. The hotel was filthy and run down. I paid the price of a 5 star hotel and the experience was akin to something out of Faulty Towers. The two bar staff ladies who were rude, aggressive and didnt bother to serve anyone food or drinks as they were complaining about how overworked they were. A spilled drink remained on the bar / cafe floor for a good hour before anyone cleaned it up. The bar was not busy as it was early afternoon, so there was no excuse for the lack of service and the rudeness.The fact that the Reception staff seemed to be familiar with these two girls and their attitude and apologised to residents on their behalf as if they were well used to them. The man at the pool reception who said he could not give me slippers as they were running low. When I told him our room had only been stocked with one pair he made me leave the swimming pool reception and go and find housekeeping to get a pair. This took me 20 minutes while my partner waited in the pool for me.
The hotel was filthy and the service a shambles. There is also a big hole in the wall on the stairs down to the pool. This hotel would fail any health and safety test were it examined.",3.8,A shambles.
