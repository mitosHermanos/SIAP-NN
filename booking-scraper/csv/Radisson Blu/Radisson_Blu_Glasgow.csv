134,United Kingdom,Standard Room,1 night ,August 2020,Couple," The breakfast was included with overall price and was amazing. Staff serving at breakfast were friendly and helpful, very quick to see to your requests. Only suggestion I would have is to maybe add toast to the menu handed out so people are aware you can order toast? Apart from this though, faultless! The room was quiet, as soon as you stepped in to the room you blocked out the outside world it was quiet and relaxing. The bed is super comfy! The lightning in the bathroom is amazing too. Currently with the pandemic there is no stocked minibar and whilst some would see this as a con, I quite liked this as me and my partner chose to use this as a fridge for our drinks and water, I liked having that choice of stocked minibar or not. The staff are some of the most friendliest you will meet they show interest in your stay and travels and are very professionally dressed, they see to your requests with such friendliness. Upon check out we left our bags for a few hours in the luggage room which I think is a great addition! It truly shows the Radisson is a more upmarket hotel yet not at an upmarket cost when paired with other nearby hotels so why wouldn’t you choose a little bit of luxury with Radisson? We had a particular great experience with a reception staff member who’s name we didn’t quite catch on his badge! Ryan? We are unsure but a special thanks to him, very kind and friendly, remembers you and takes great interest in your stay."," Having stayed previously I know how faultless this hotel can be however, there were a few hiccups on this occasion. I find the ice machine on each floor a great asset and highlight to this hotel however, none on floor 2 and 3 had been filled. However, when we phoned down to reception they asked if we were aware of the ice machines, when we explained they brought us up a bucket of ice to our room in under 5 minutes. Another hiccup was the water wasn’t working properly when we arrived (no cold water and was green in colour) however when we phoned reception they didn’t specify why but said they’d sort it and quickly rectified the situation, even phoning to check in that it was clear. My guess would be in light of current situations in the world right now it’s hard to keep on top of everything but the staff make up for it with efficiency.",8.0,"Relaxing, quiet, comfortable and still my favourite hotel!"

I eventually found a spot on the street and walked several blocks to the hotel, which I had passed (but not the parking entrance).  The signage from the road is hard to see and combined with the poor support from my satnav is the reason why I struggled I think.  But the people at the hotel, once I did get there, were really helpful and drew me a map so I could move my car.  Once I had this in hand, it was no problem at all.",10,Lovely hotel for a nice weekend break that is a bit special

465,United Kingdom,Standard Room,3 nights ,August 2019,Couple," The shopping, lovely jewellery arcade, especially the oldie worldie jewellers (which I always frequent, los of antique jewellery that's different...oops and spent a few grand ......well not my money), Ohhh and the pubs, I like Waxy O'connors, we always go in there.....it's like the house that jack built...In fact everywhere around George Square area is nice......arrr yes The Anchor, lovely place to eat and drink, a bit more upmarket (you don't have to dress up or anything) and The Counting House where we had a drink with Bonnie Prince Charlie.......Crikey the buildings are gorgeous, the architecture could rival London any day (not the crap high rises of London) but the buildings that were made to last.....and do last.....I love going there at least once a year.....(off to Edinburgh soon...spooky vaults and Mary King's close....must see....)
By the way kids have to be over 18 to get into the places I mentioned, especially after a certain time and they are very strict on that which is good).  If it's a pub that sells food then I think it's ok.  But I was always in my bed by 8.....knackered, all that shopping, it's exercise in itself......arrr yes you can even take their funny teeny weeny tube from the bottom of Buchanan to the top (which I did on a rainy day (as my partner had a hangover)...costs £1.70??? or thereabouts....anyway you can't get lost as the tube only goes round and round and round.
The 2 young girls are our friends daughters and they wouldn't let them in at first, til their dad had a word, they are 21 and 18....for heavens sake...I've also added The Anchor Line eatery and drinkng place and a lovely building...The Counting House, yours truly in waxy's being daft and the other half.......after the hangover....giggles....."," The bathroom could have done with a pull out shaving mirror (but that's not to say I didn't like the hotel).  The hotel was ok but to get to Buchanan Street (nice shopping area) you have to go under a rail brdge which is full of the most undesireable people 24/7, drunk, being sick, begging....you get the picture.  I also notice a massive change in the population since last year as you can see in The Anchor Line photo...",7.5,A really nice stay (except for the dossers) hahahaha.

476,United Kingdom,Standard Room,1 night ,September 2019,Couple," The hotel is very clean, appears modern and I found the staff both helpful and efficient.  Being next to Central Station means these premises are in a really handy central location within easy walking distance of shops, bars and food.  Of course, you can almost fall from the station into the Hotel if you arrive by train.  The breakfast here is faultless - everyting you could imagine and quality too."," Well, our stay was somewhat marred by a couple of problems.  First up we returned to our room (606, on the top floor) at around 9:30pm to be greeted by the most terrible noise resonating through the roof from what would appear to be the buildings cooling units above - seemingly with some rough bearings!  Being a Brit, I'm not a complainer, however this was awful and neither of us could sleep.  Reception handled the issue without question and moved us to another room, somewhat smaller and next to a disco being held for a function in the building.  Wow that was noisey, but it stopped at 11pm meaning finally, we could sleep.
My issue is that the hotel clearly knew there was an issue with the rooms on the top floor and it didnt come as a surprise to them when I asked to be moved.  I personally feel this its a bit of a naughty tactic to sell the room, knowing there is a problem and hope nobody complains - especially in this classification of hotel.
Disapointing to have our stay and comfort spolied by issues which the premises were capable of avoiding.  In defence however, my £15 parking charge was waived as an apology.",7.9,"Lovely, but could do better."

Breakfast was excellent.," Upon arrival we were disappointed with the layout of the room  - a post in the middle of the room made it difficult to see the TV and to easily move around the room - and the shower door leaked which left the bathroom floor wet through to brush your teeth etc - but settled in and accepted fine.  We went out into Glasgow and on return the whole of our landing smelt very badly of smoking.  We went into our room and it was worse - it was coming through the air conditioning.  When we advised reception they told us that we were on the floor with smoking rooms!!!  We booked a no smoking room and asked to be moved but they refused as they said all other rooms were full. This wasn't true as we looked at the availability online.  We should have been advised that we were on a smoking corridor and that our room would smell badly.  Very disingenuous of the hotel and very poor customer service when asked to be moved.  Completely spoiled our weekend away with no acknowledgement or apology from any staff.  When we checked out, no one asked if our staff had been ok so we weren't even given the opportunity to give feedback.",7.5,Disappointing unneccesarily.

The bathroom could do with a bit of TLC, loose fittings, poor shower (powerful but dangerously varying water temperatures).

The situation of the building means that access to other parts of the city, if you wish to go on foot, is good."," It is highly disingenuous to advertise a 3 course meal for £24.99 and then charge for vegetables; the food is nouvelle cuisine, which means it looks pretty but is hardly satisfying. I had to pay £3.50 for 3 slices of carrot, beet and parsnip and a further £3.50 for a small basket of chips. I could have hung the starter on the wall and framed it. The dessert was good.
My room was large and well appointed, but it was right next door to some kind of fan system ( air conditioning for the whole hotel) which was noisy and made sleeping difficult to begin with.

1444,United Kingdom,Standard Room,3 nights ,September 2019,Solo traveler," The location of the Radisson Blu hotel in Glasgow is one of the major reasons why I choose to stay at the hotel as it is  located next to Glasgow Central Railway Station and the main shopping centre for Central Glasgow.  
St. Enoch Metro is  a short walking distance away.  
Merchant city and West End of Glasgow is also close to the Radisson Blu hotel. 
Glasgow International is a 15 minute taxi journey from the hotel.
The hotel itself was well maintained and cleanliness was generally good.
There is a restaurant and bar at the hotel.
The restaurant has 2 bars one within the restaurant area of the hotel and another bar located on the corner of the hotel.
The breakfast service provided by the hotel offers a good choice of food to cater for all tastes.
I was highly impressed by how well the morning restaurant manager managed the operation of the busy restaurant and how attentive her team were in serving all the customers quickly and efficiently with a smile on their faces and the utmost courtesy given to all customers.
I want to say well done and thank you to Alexandra the morning restaurant manager and her  team on their dedication and professionalism."," First of all this criticism is to Booking com because as a customer booking a hotel room,  I have to trust the information provided to me on the Booking.com App.
Unfortunately Booking.com really misled me and has most probably misled many other customers because the photographs Booking.com are showing for a Standard room at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Glasgow do not in any way actually resemble the actual Standard rooms at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Glasgow.
I based my choice of selecting a Standard Room on the advertised photographs shown on the Booking.com App.The photographs shown of a Standard room at the Radisson Blu hotel on the Booking.com App are of a Premium room and not a Standard Room.
This is utterly unacceptable and misleading customers.
When I  checked into the hotel and went to my room, I was shocked and very upset to find my room was bright red and had wooden flooring.
This was not want I expected and I immediately went back to the Hotel Reception desk and informed the  reception team member that I  can not stay in the room.
Thankfully the reception team offered me another room  to stay in at no extra cost which resembled the type of room being advertised on the Booking.com App for a Standard room at the Radisson Blu hotel in Glasgow.
Another issue that I found strange was that the hotel takes a £50 per night security deposit if you want to use the hotel bar after 12 midnight.
So the hotel will immediately take deposit on your credit card for you as a customer to be able to purchase drinks at the bar after 12 midnight.
The hotel bar does not take any cash as payment and will only take payment on your credit card.
I stayed 3 nights and I had to pay a deposit of £150.00.
The deposit is refunded back to your credit cards a few days after you check out.
What my point is that the hotel even after paying the £50 per night deposit still takes payments which are charged to your room account.
I do not understand the real purpose of this £50 deposit  rule.",6.7,Pleasant

As an aside - A particular male staff member/ bouncer was very rude and intimidating on us returning back to the hotel after 10pm with our children.

1538,United Kingdom,Junior Suite,3 nights ,October 2018,Solo traveler, Location.," MY STAY AT THE RADISSON BLU GLASGOW from 11 October to 14th October 2018
I stayed at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Glasgow from the evening of Thursday 11th October until the morning of Sunday 14th October 2018.
As this was my third visit I had booked the Junior Suite from some months in advance, having previously stayed in their standard, and then their business class occasions.  I was quoted and took what I considered a good price of £500 plus for the 3 nights.
Apart from the suite being very cold at night due to it having only wooden floors (not carpet as I had expected) everything went well until the morning of Saturday 13th October when one of the staff at Reception behaved incorrectly and was rude to me and my guests.  The member of Staff had a name tag that read Praveen.
As on previous occasions I came to Glasgow to visit my friends – a mother and her daughter.  They visited me on Friday and we sat in the seating area of my suite (which is why I booked the suite in the first place) and enjoyed lunch together in the Collage Bar.
On Saturday morning I awaited their arrival in the lobby as the Collage bar was closed and as part of the lobby was under construction I waited for them in the corner. Mr. Praveen came and asked me whether he could help, and I said I was awaiting friends.  I was friendly to him and wished him “bless you” in Hindi (I am from Malaysia) to which he was quick to say that he wasn’t Indian but that one of his parents was French…
When my friends arrived at 9.30 am  , I went to greet them, and he promptly came up and asked us where we were going so I replied to my suite whereupon he officiously told us that only 2 people were allowed in the suite due to fire regulations.  I pointed out to him that my friends were NOT STAYING and were just visiting but he insisted at which point I told him that I had a suite with a separate seating area and that was why I booked a suite and he said he would check. My guests were most offended.
He never came",5.4,Fair

However having arrived at around 9.45am most of the hot buffet dishes were almost empty also the Loren sausage and breakfast was so over cooked or over heated it was so dried up and therefore inedible. To add to this we saw all the hot dishes being switched off at 10.15am and then advised by staff that the buffet would be unavailable at 10.30! We noticed guests arriving at 10.20 and 10.25 which was unacceptable to guests as staff were starting to remove the cold items from the buffet. We are Club Carlson members and regular users of the Raddidon at London Stansted but sadly found this experience very poor.

The glass wall between the bathroom and room was odd too couldn't leave a light on at night. Pitch black room and the TV on the column meant a banged head.
