From what was supposed to be a 3pm check in turned into checking in at 7:45pm because the hotel forgot to call to tell me it was ready."," I understand it was a busy night and the hotel were understaffed but hearing that our room was given away to another group who extended their stay was concerning. I was understanding that the team had to make another room but waiting 4 hours is ridiculous. My friend and I had a function at 9:30pm and therefore only had 1.5 hrs to get ready and spend time in the room I paid a lot of money for and wanted to relax in after a hard week. The customer service for the inconvenience was next to nothing. Yes there was a verbal apology but there wasn’t any mention of anything to make it up to us besides a whole orange, pear and mandarin sent to our room. The least the hotel could do would be to give me a credit, a bigger room or complimentary dinner. In the morning I was still little disappointed and so I asked for a late checkout and complimentary breakfast for my friend and I for which the manager said okay. When I checked my emails at home, I was charged $65 for this so called complimentary breakfast... im angry and I will not stay here again.",7.9,Disappointing

That's fine so I went to reception (3m away) and confirmed myself. Then I went to inform the porter that I was indeed checked out. The concierge got himself involved for no reason to confuse things. Fine.
Then after everything was solved, no thank to the concierge, he decided to move from his desk and approach me in the waiting area to inform me that concierge and reception are two different things and that he cannot pass messages on (3m to his right).
If that's a rule, fine.
He then went on to lecturer me the difference between a concierge and reception and that ""I might not be able to COMPREHEND the difference""
My reply was swift.
As an international pilot, I assure you I can comprehend the difference and in fact I am very familiar with a far more impressive service than yours. 
The fact he removed himself from his station after I SOLVED the issue to insult my intelligence was very unusual and disconcerting.

In the event our time ran out (Vivid Festival) and we felt highly satisfied with our own explorations. However, the possibility of formalising a building tour appeals.

Our room had a beautiful bathroom, was spacious and light."," At reception they couldn't find my booking and were rather abrupt in dealing with the situation, which was in fact their own administrative error. Anyway, that aside, having paid a reasonable amount for the accomodation, we were excited to be offered an upgraded to a superior twin double room, from a standard double room. The reception told us this room would be more spacious and we (as a couple) could just choose which bed to sleep in, as it had two double bed. Unfortunately, the beds were pretty small doubles, so I can only imagine they were smaller than the standard double room bed size, which is understandable if one person is anticipated to sleep in each bed, but as a couple, I don't know if this was really a good upgrade to have been given. Additionally, there was loud music playing until the early hours of the morning, which didn't help with obtaining a comfortable nights sleep. In the morning, we had also paid for breakfast to be included. On making our way to the breakfast room we were taken to a table and given a menu with priced item, no explanation. After being left for a considerable amount of time, the same waiter came back and asked if we'd been served. We proceeded to ask about the breakfast, being understanding that buffet style is not suitable in the current global situation, but being a little confused having been given a menu with different prices and options and not knowing what exactly our prepayment entitled us to. Once explained we ordered from the menu as directed, however the resulting dishes were disappointing at most. With a very small offering to begin with, you'd hope the dishes were at least worthy of their spot on the menu. However, the orange juice (priced on the menu at $7, one glass of which was included in our breakfast allowance) was very poor quality and came in a very small glass.",7.0,Night Away

I asked the receptionist again about my request, but she was asking for an additional 65 Dollars to give me another room. I find that disappointing, as the room was already expensive enough, and paying this price I was hoping for more.

1286,Australia,,1 night ,December 2018,Family," We stayed for 1 night as a treat, after my sons weekend of coding/robotics championships at the Macqaurie University.  
We chose this hotel due to location to Darling Harbour and its sights (approx 15 min walk) and Wynyard train station (approx 3 - 5 min walk), which would take us to the Domestic Airport the next day.  The Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge are also only 15 min walk each away.
I was pleasantly surprised when we got an upgraded room (1st time upgraded ever...hoo hoo)  We were originally booked for a standard double room with atrium view, and ended up with 2 double beds with street views.  The bathroom was enormous, and all areas scrupulously clean, and loved that I had a massive bed to myself!!  I enjoyed seeing the old photos in the hallways of the historic building.
We went to Darling harbour for dinner, and there were plenty of choices to choose from (Bars, Seafood, Steak Houses, Hard Rock, Australian etc)  I researched cafes for breakfast (and there were plenty of options nearby), but my son loves a good hotel buffet, so we did that as a treat.  Had the usual buffet fare.
Our flight didn't leave until 8pm on the day of check out, so loved that we were able to leave our bags at concierge until about 5pm, so we could continue to sightsee without lugging them around with us.
